            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Infant Baptiſm Conſidered, and the true Grounds thereof laid down, Opened, and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apoſtle adviſing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5. That every one [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] be fully carried, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his mind in the things that he acts toward the Lord (as all we do we are to do in his Name, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17.) and I having been exerciſed with doubts and ſcruples in my mind (the rather by occaſion of oppoſition ſometimes met with) about Infant-Baptiſm, it put me upon a more diligent Search of Scripture, together with other means of ſatisfaction thereabout. In which ſearch, what I have found, I have here ſet down, as well for the helpfulneſs of others that may be exerciſed with like doubts, as alſo that it being tryed what is found light therein, may be diſcovered, and others hereby oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned to hold forth clearer light.</p>
            <p>And firſt I ſhall propound what I find in Scripture more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concerning Baptiſm, (the want of right underſtanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in adminiſtring much occaſion of the doubts and miſtakes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about) and then deſcend more particularly to what may thence be deduced for Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt then, I find for the kinds or ways of Baptizing, a three-fold kind or way, all tending to make up and effect that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one Baptiſm ſpoken of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4. the waſhing, cleanſing, and fitting a man for Gods everlaſting Kingdom. Some call them <hi>Flaminis, Fluminis, Sanguinis,</hi> to which ſome adde a fourth <hi>Sermonis.</hi> The Scripture thus,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Baptiſm of, or with the Spirit, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5. <hi>He ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which is the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112427:6"/> out of the Spirit upon men, on ſome more plenteouſly, on others in leſs meaſure, according to his good pleaſure, to teach, ſanctifie, and fit them for the inheritance and ſervice they are called to, &amp; to <hi>ſeal them up to the day of redemption,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13, 14, 15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13, 14. &amp; 4.30. The ſpeaking with tongues in the firſt pouring out of the Spirit, was neither common to them all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 30. nor for continuance in all Ages, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. being but a more miraculous &amp; evident demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he was indeed pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out upon them, and ſo of the faithfulneſs of Chriſt therein for clearer ſatisfaction to others, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.45, 46. &amp; 11.15, 16, 17, 18. &amp; for preſent uſefulneſs to them that ſpake with them, for being fited to carry forth the Goſpel to peoples of divers languages, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.21. and alſo for ſignes to unbelievers that did not credit that Doctrine, nor receive the Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22. But the other operations of the Spirit are of more general uſefulneſs &amp; continuance, &amp; therfore this Baptiſm in that regard is moſt neceſſary; But of this is not our buſineſs herein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Baptiſm of Fire, or with Afflictions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. &amp; 20.22, 23, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called a Baptiſm becauſe through the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt for us, they are not for deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction but correction, they are ordered to us (and by him ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) for our cleanſing and purging, which being effected accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his gracious mind, we come out of them again, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 8, 9, 10. <hi>Job.</hi> 33.29. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.12. of which though all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not alike, ſome are more deeply plunged into them, ſome more lightly ſprinkled with them, yet all in ſome meaſure partake that will live godly in Chriſt, and are Gods children, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Baptiſm with water, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 10 47. <hi>I indeed baptize you with water.</hi> To theſe three, ſome, as I ſaid above add;</p>
            <p>A Fourth, Of the Word, becauſe the word <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times comprehends alſo the Doctrine baptized into, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.25, 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.37. And indeed the word is compared to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter frequently, and therewith God doth beſprinkle and waſh the ſouls of men, and makes them clean, as <hi>John</hi> 15.3. yet I think this rather accompanies the ſeveral ways of Baptiſm before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, as being that that the Baptiſm of water obliges to, and ſeals, that which the Spirit properly baptizes with, and by, and that which afflictions are ordered to ſeal home, and bore the ear of the ſoul unto, then that the Scripture calleth it by it ſelf a Baptiſm,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112427:6"/> however this is not it that our enquiry is particularly about, but about that of, or with water. Concerning which,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, I find the Grounds thereof in Scripture, are either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. More general and fundamental, <hi>viz.</hi> The grace of God towards poor loſt man teſtified in the gift of his Son to be the Saviour of the world by ſuffering for its ſin, removing its curſe, and procuring life, and bleſſing for it into himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17. &amp; 6.51. according to that to <hi>Abraham, In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations and Families of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> This indeed is the main foundation and ground of all Gods gracious dealings with, and diſpenſations to the ſons of men, and of all his Ordinances both before, and ſince his coming; only with this difference that thoſe before his coming were ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, and to mind and lead us to him, as one to come; thoſe ſince, are grounded upon his being actually come in the fleſh, and upon his being perfected through his ſufferings, for bringing bleſſing to all families of men, and ſaving to the utmoſt all that obey him; that this word of the beginning of Chriſt is the foundation of Baptiſings, in all its ways, is clear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. For indeed otherwiſe no Goſpel nor Baptiſm into it, no Diſpenſation of Spirit to us; Afflictions had been deſtructions, not corrections; and ſo in particular its the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Baptiſm we ſpeak of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More immediately, and particularly; The Commiſſion given for baptizing, which I find was two-fold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One to <hi>John</hi> called then the Baptiſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.2, 3. called the <hi>Baptiſm of repentance,</hi> becauſe joyned with a Doctrine detecting the falſe confidences, and erring ways of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from Chriſt the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the free-grace of God in him, and ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ling them to repent of them, and turn in again to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.2. <hi>John</hi> 1.15.29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other, to the Diſciples and Apoſtles of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. and between theſe two I find no difference preſcribed as to the form of acting, only in theſe two things. 1. <hi>John's</hi> was to be practiſed upon the <hi>Jews</hi> only, and ſo ſuch as were before members of the Church of God. The Diſciples upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipling them. 2. <hi>John's</hi> was unto Chriſt to be revealed to them, and for revealing him while he was but yet about his work for us on the earth: The Diſciples was chiefly after his Aſcenſion into the Name of Chriſt, as more fully and clearly revealed, and ſo into the Name, and to the worſhip of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly opened in their Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the Ends of this Baptiſm, I find it is,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:112427:7"/>1. Negatively, Not to diſtinguiſh between chaff &amp; wheat, the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and carnal ſeed, that's Chriſts own work, not his ſervants, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.12 &amp; 22.10, 11, 12. nor to approve the ſtate of every ſuch perſon as is baptized, &amp; ſeal to them an undoubted enjoyment of Eternal life, or that they are really, and in Spirit one with God &amp; Chriſt, or the like.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But Affirmatively. 1. On Gods, and the Adminiſtrators part, miniſtring in the Name of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To hold forth, ratifie, and confirm the truth of the Contents of the Goſpel, and ſo to witneſs to the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt brought unto men, ſo <hi>John</hi> not as a man barely, but as a Preacher and Baptiſer witneſſed to Chriſt, and ſo were the Apoſtles to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him in all their Miniſtration as God himſelf doth by them; <hi>John</hi> 1.7.15.29. &amp; 15.26, 27. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10, 11. yea, as all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God both before, and ſince his coming, ſtand upon him as the gift of Gods love to man, ſo as the <hi>Cherubims</hi> of old to the Mercy-ſeat, they all look and witneſs to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. And ſo in Baptiſm particularly, God, and the Adminiſter as from God, holds forth intimately the uncleanneſs that is in men one or other, by their natural birth, or humane actings, the emptineſs of all their own righteouſneſs though after the Law; And that in Jeſus Chriſt by his death and reſurrection for them there is forgiveneſs and redemption for them, and bleſſing, even righteouſneſs and life brought unto them, which in ſubmitting to him, and his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhall certainly receive from him, and that he will by his Word and Spirit, ſo waſh, cleanſe, and ſanctifie them, as to make them meet for fellowſhip with God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To teſtifie and declare, that neither God nor they (in caſe they be guilful in the receit of this Ordinance, and grace tendered there with) do hold them bound under the guilt of former, either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, or actual pollution, ſo as to hold them out from his Church, or Kingdom, but do remit all paſt, ſo as not to refuſe to admit them to fellowſhip with themſelves in his Church, its ordinances, and bleſſings, as they be capable thereof. So I look upon that in <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. <hi>Waſh away thy ſins,</hi> with <hi>Acts</hi> 10.28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On the Baptized's part it is, 1. That he might have the promiſes held forth, ſealed, and ratified to him. 2. To diſciple him to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo ſubject them to his Regiment, teaching a way of worſhip appointed and taught by him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple all the Nations, or Gentiles, baptizing them,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt;</hi> that is, unto
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112427:7"/> the receit, belief, and acknowledgement of the Doctrine of God, as ſo diſtinctly made known, and into the worſhip of him, the only true God, the Father by, through, and as made known by, and in the Son, his Mediation and Doctrine, declared and opened by the Holy Ghoſt in the Goſpel, and in his power working there-through in the heart, teaching them to obſerve all things that I command you, &amp;c. <hi>Even as the people of Iſrael in being baptized in the cloud and ſea, were obliged to believe and obey Moſes, and the Lord as ordering them by him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. and ſo alſo by being circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2.3. And herein <hi>they that are baptized, are baptized into the death of Chriſt,</hi> to expect all their life there-through, and follow him therein, and do in this ſence <hi>put on Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3.26, 27. that is, An Engagement an Obligation to liſten to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, as they have him declared, and are capable of liſtening to, and believing on him, and ſo a profeſſed ſubjection to his order, and to worſhip God by him, and take content in the grace in him, even as being further baptized by his Spirit in the opening the truth to their hearts, and ſhedding his love abroad therein, they more really and ſpiritually put him on by way of actual confidence, and faith in him, as their righteouſneſs, rejoycing, and compleat redemption and ſalvation, and his vertues by being conformed to him; and the more yet by being alſo <hi>baptized with trials and afflictions, Rom.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.21, 22. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.13, 14, 15. 3. To admit the baptized into the Church, and Kingdom of God, and ſo to have the Name of God and of Chriſt put upon them. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, may alſo be underſtood, <hi>Baptizing them into the Name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> So as that they may have the Name of the true God upon them, be, and be called the people, or Church of God, Chriſtians; as of old the Name of God was by Circumciſion put upon <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and ſo alſo to bring them under the protection, help, and bleſſing of that Name. For where Gods Name is put upon, and own'd by any people, God hath reſpect unto them for his Names ſake, and for that cauſe often ſpares, helps, and bleſſes them, that he might glorifie his Name upon them, and make other people know, that it is better to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, worſhippers, and callers upon him, and under his protection, then any other Gods, or powers whatſoever: To this purpoſe are theſe Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124.8. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.9, 14. <hi>&amp;c. Jer.</hi> 14.7. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.8, 9. 4. And ſo to diſtinguiſh them from all other peoples that are not baptized into the Name of Chriſt, and receive not his Goſpel, as <hi>Acts</hi> 11.26. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.18, 19. And to oblige them to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112427:8"/> unity in judgement and affection amongſt themſelvs, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10.13 <hi>I beſeech you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (which is but one, and is upon you all) <hi>that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among you, but that ye be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgement. Not to ſay, I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, I am of Luther, I am of Calvin, I am of Arminius;</hi> to make and maintain Parties, Sects, and Factions, in the Church; but every one to own truth from, or by any one, and ſingly follow after it, and all own themſelves only obliged to Chriſt, and his Name, and to every one to each other for that Name ſake; whence it follows, were ye baptized into the Name of <hi>Paul,</hi> that ye ſhould only cleave to him, and neglect, and ſlight all other the ſervants of Chriſt for <hi>Pauls</hi> ſake, and only follow and cry him up. Which might be applyed to our diviſions, were we bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into the Name of <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or the like, and ſo to diviſions nearer home. The being all baptized into the Name of Chriſt, ſhould make us all adhere to Chriſt, and to receive his truth by any one he ſpeaks it by, and love one another for his ſake, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that alſo, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Concerning the <hi>Subject</hi> of Baptiſm, the thing principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after in this Diſcourſe. 1. I find not any Scripture in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words ſay, That Infants are to be baptized, or inſtancing that the Apoſtles did baptize Infants. 2. I find not any Scripture expreſly or intimately prohibit the Baptiſm of Infants, or denying that they were baptized. For, 3. I find not any Scripture ſay, That only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may be, or were baptized, or none but ſuch as have repented, do confeſs their ſins, profeſs faith, &amp;c. 4. I find indeed, that in the firſt practiſe of Baptiſm, it being preacht to men of age and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, with the doctrine it baptized into, they being perſwaded to receive that doctrine, and be baptized into it, did ſome of them <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their ſins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3 6. Acts 8.38, 39.</note> others, <hi>profeſs their faith,</hi> And ſuch were baptized, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not ever before they, or their Fore-fathers been inſtructed into that doctrine, or been baptized thereinto. But, 5. I find not that either <hi>John,</hi> or Chriſts Diſciples ever turned away any that came to be baptized of them. That Poſition of the Antipedobaptiſts, That <hi>John Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>turned away the Phariſees and Sadduces,</hi> is without proof. It's true, that divers (yea, prabably moſt) of the <hi>Phariſees contemned his Baptiſm, and rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves, Luke</hi> 7.30. but neither <hi>John,</hi> nor any other ſervant of Chriſt, is ever ſaid to have rejected them there-from. <hi>John</hi> in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:112427:8"/> that <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. indeed takes them up more roughly then he did ſome other, as more needing it, (and yet <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>he ſaid the ſame to the multitude, Luke</hi> 3.7.) but withall ſays, <hi>he baptized them.</hi> For ſo are the words, <hi>I indeed baptize you, Mat.</hi> 3.11.6. Thence I find too, That the Subject of this Baptiſm was not a truly ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> born of the Spirit, either as adminiſtred by <hi>John,</hi> or Chriſts Diſciples; for <hi>Iohn</hi> calls them he baptized, a <hi>generation of vipers,</hi> an Epithite too harſh for perſons truly regenerate,<note place="margin">Luke 3.7</note> and ſays, he baptized them not upon their repentance, or that had repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>unto repentance,</hi> that they might, or inſtructing them, <hi>that they ſhould repent, Matth.</hi> 3.11. And ſo not upon faith, but ſaying, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>That they ſhould believe in him that is to come, Acts</hi> 19.3, 4. Thence alſo it's ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not upon, or after uſually, but for, or unto the remiſſion of ſins: Yea, <hi>John</hi> plainly intimates, <hi>that he admitted chaff as well as wheat into the floor, and ſuch as ſhould be burnt in unquenchable ſire, Matth.</hi> 3.12. he baptizing ſuch as ſtill received the Name of <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans;</hi> yea, all the people, the generality doubtleſs of them, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29. &amp; 3.21. And for Chriſts Diſciples, they baptized and diſcipled ſuch as our Saviour that well knew them, tells us, <hi>did not believe, John</hi> 6.64. yea, <hi>ſuch as were in the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity after their baptiſm, Acts</hi> 8.23. yea, <hi>they brought into the houſe all they found, good and bad, Mat.</hi> 22.9, 10, 11, 12. &amp; 13.47, 48. 7. I find indeed, that once the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his friends, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44 48. <hi>They being uncircumciſed Gentiles in the fleſh;</hi> and therefore God to demonſtrate that they were thenceforth amongſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be admitted into the Church by Baptiſm without Circumciſion, (the want whereof was no impediment to him for having fellowſhip with them, and to take away ſcruple from the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> that they might alſo admit them to their fellowſhip without it) poured forth his Spirit firſt on them, whence <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>Can any forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized that have received the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> But 8. I find that uſually perſons were baptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch receit of the Holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. &amp; 8.12, 13, 16. Yea, 9. I find that divers being converted <hi>had their whole families baptized with them,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31, 33. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. And ſome the faith of whoſe family before Baptiſm there is not the leaſt mention of, as <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14, 15. But now happily it will be ſaid, That here is enough ſaid againſt Infant-baptiſm, becauſe it's granted that no Scripture expreſly ſays, that Infants were, or ought
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:112427:9"/> to be baptized; which is indeed the great pillar upon which Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſm leaneth, nor matter they that no Scripture ſayes, they were not, or ought not. <hi>For what is not written,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is not to be believed, or practiſed.</hi> Concerning which, I propound to further conſideration. 1. Whether that <hi>Maxime</hi> ſtrikes not down one main pillar of theirs. For if what is not written, is not to be believed, then its not to be believed that all that were baptized were capable of faith, or (rather) actually profeſſed it before Baptiſm. For its not written, that either all in the Jaylours houſe, or that any in <hi>Lydia's</hi> houſe beſide her ſelf profeſt it before Baptiſm, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15.33. the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>believed in, ver.</hi> 34. is of the ſingular Number, and agrees with the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> &amp; ſo is the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>rejoyced,</hi> and word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>(houſe wholly)</hi> is ſuch, as concludes not all in the houſe actually either in believing, or rejoycing, it may ſignifie as well in, or concerning all his houſe, as with them all as companions in thoſe act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>The Prophet calls the women with their ſucking Infants to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble ſolemnly, &amp; to humble themſelves before the Lord, Joel</hi> 2.12. 14, 15. And <hi>Nineveh</hi> men &amp; beaſts are ſaid, <hi>to cry to God, and put on ſackcloth;</hi> and yet its certain that neither the beaſts nor Infants were active in thoſe repentings, &amp; ſolemn humiliations. And as for <hi>Lydia's</hi> houſe, not a word of any of them hearing the word, or believing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſm. And the like we might ſay of the <hi>houſhold of Stephanas,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. Therefore if nothing is to be believed that the word is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in, why preſs they upon men to believe that all that were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed did profeſs faith, and repentance firſt, ſeeing it's more then can be proved? 2. It's to be examined, whether it be true and right or not, that we are to believe, or do nothing but what we have ſome expreſs Command of Chriſt, or example of the Apoſtles <hi>in terminis,</hi> to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us in. I ſuppoſe its not every way currant: for by that rule its not lawful for a man that is a Chriſtian to take upon him the Office of a Magiſtrate, or Civil government over Chriſtian people; For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath Chriſt, not any of his Apoſtles in expreſs terms commanded it, nor did any of the Apoſtles practiſe it. The like we might ſay for keeping the firſt day of the week, or any one ſet day for a Sabbath, for tranſlating the Scriptures into our <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue, and for womens partaking of the Supper, though a thing generally allowed of, even by the Antipedobaptiſts. If a man of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious ſpirit lifted, he might make as great ſtirs about it to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the Church, as is made about Infant-baptiſm, for there is neither expreſs Command of Chriſt, or practiſe of the Apoſtles, or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112427:9"/> Churches in their times in which there is expreſs mention of womens participation of it in all the Scriptures, no more then for Infant Baptiſm. The inſtitution of the Supper was at the Paſſover (whereof neither is there any where expreſs mention that any woman ever did eat) with the twelve Apoſtles or Diſciples who are numbred up and named, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. and its evident enough they were all men, and it was to them that he ſayd, Take eat &amp;c. and drink ye all of this; and do ye this as oft as ye eat it, &amp;c. in remembrance of me. If any ſhall ſay that that <hi>all</hi> was a repreſentative of the whol Church, he may happily ſay true but more then by any expreſs Scripture he can prove. I know no one expreſſion in Scripture that ſays either let women participate of it, or that women did; and thats as much as is mainly urged againſt Infant Baptiſm there were its true three Thouſand converted in one day, and then they continued in breaking of bread, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. but that any of them were wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is no more expreſt, then that when its ſaid all the people were bapeized, there were ſome Infants amongſt them, in the fourth of the <hi>Acts.</hi> verſ. 4. where the number of the men is ſaid to be five Thouſand (which is conceived to be the number of them in general that were converted, and not only of thoſe that were converted at <hi>Peters</hi> ſecond Sermon there mentioned) the word is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>n it concern women and not men, as about ſilence in the Churches, and covering their heads, <hi>cap.</hi> 11. &amp; 14. And other things men and not women, as in the ſame Chapters, however its evident that here is no expreſs commandement nor practiſe of the Churches related, in which there is expreſs mention of womens partaking of the Supper, and I think all Churches agree about it, that its lawfull and good that they partake of it. So that the bare want of expreſs command in ſo many words or of the like expreſs mentioning a thing as practiſed by the Apoſtles, is no ſufficient ground to conclude a practiſe ſinfull, they that make that their rule in approving or condemning practiſes might make as great
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:112427:10"/> diſturbances in other things that are warrantable enough as well as in Infant Baptiſm. For,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Its to be conſidered further, that Chriſt is not ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall in his precepts or injunctions of outward meer poſitive Ordinances as <hi>Moſes</hi> was: <hi>Moſes,</hi> or rather God to and by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſets down to every pin and peg in the Tabernacle, how it muſt be made, and delivers more circumſtantially the commands of Circumciſion and Paſſover as the age and time in which they were to be done, how often and in what form, but ſo doth not Chriſt, he hath not by himſelf or by his Apoſtles ſet down at what certain age a man ſhould be Baptized, or eate the Supper, nor in what Form, whether all the body or ſome part of it muſt be dipt, or waſhed in Baptiſm, how often and upon what times of the year the Supper is to be taken, nor in what geſture. He hath not bounded the Church thus in the circumſtances of his Ordinances. Nay he hath not as we noted before, ſaid any where, ye may, or ye may not <hi>(in terminis)</hi> Baptiſe Infants, or ye muſt not Baptiſe men till they have firſt beleeved.</p>
            <p>Now whereas its commonly objected, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> that this is to make Chriſt a leſs perfect and faithfull mediator and diſpenſer of the things of God then <hi>Moſes;</hi> in my minde its ignorantly ſpoken, and they that ſo object conſider not in what the faithfulneſs and perfection of Chriſts miniſtration above <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtandeth. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sure his faithfulneſs ſtands in this,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> 
               <hi>That he diſcharge al that Office that his Father hath impoſed upon him, be it what it will.</hi> Now if his Father no where injoyned him to ſuch circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateneſs in his Ordinances, he is not chargeable with unfaithfulneſs if he do not ſo circumſtantiate them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a ſervant and amongſt ſervants, and his Law was a miniſtration of ſervitude, and though to ſons alſo, yet to ſons under age, and nothing different from ſervants in reſpect of tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, even the moſt beleeving of them:<note place="margin">Gal. 4.1, 2. Heb. 3.2, 5.</note> But Chriſt is the Son in his houſe, in which are ſons alſo not under that or the like tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, yea his people are to him in the capacity of a wife or Spouſe. Now whether is greater perfection to lead to, and leave at, more liberty in externall matters not morrall, or to bind up to more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude and with more charges. Servants and Schollers may have every part of their work ſet them with more formality or exact mention of every punctilio, eſpecially while under none age, but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:112427:11"/> a wife or ſon more grown, may be left more to liberty and their diſcretion, and not ſo bound and tyed up with outward formall precepts. Nor follows it thence, that then we have greater liberty to ſin;<note place="margin">Rom. 4.15.</note> 
               <hi>for, where no Law is, there is no tranſgreſſion:</hi> there is no ſin in thoſe things but whyt ſtands in croſſing a poſitive Law, or binding upon men, that as a Law, that he hath left at liberty and not bound us to; theſe things being applyed onely to things of externall Form and Ordinance, not to the things of the inſide and Spirit, and what flows from thence of morall practiſe, ſuch as the love of God and man with the branches of it, which are due from us, though God ſhould not expreſly by word injoyn them to us, there being a Law of Nature and Grace too, to injoyn us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But to come more up to the buſineſs: In the Law was a leſs diſcovery of love, and more of ſervice in carnal things, ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out thoſe ſpiritual things in which the love of God was more brightly to be evidenced: In the Goſpel is more diſcovery of Love, and therefore more ſpirit, and leſs carnal ſervice. As the Sun grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing higher, the ſhadows ſhorten; So the Goſpel being now more clear, the ſhadows of external Ceremonies or Documents are leſs inſiſted on.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The time of the Law being as the time of Infancy, and leſs growth in underſtanding, and the time of the Goſpel as the time of riper years; as men grown can take hints of things, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Speakers mind in them, when little children need to be told plainly every circumſtance: So then, the Miniſtration fitted to thoſe times needed to be more circumſtantial; whereas now having the light and help of thoſe former Documents, ſome hints in Scripture may declare the Will of Chriſt to our underſtanding, where there are no ſuch exact expreſs mentionings of it. So that that Objection vaniſhes. It's ſo far from being Antichriſtianiſm, and a denying of Chriſt come in the fleſh (as ſome would have it) to ſay, that Chriſt is leſs exact in the matters of external Forms, rhat it's rather Antichriſtianiſm, and a tacit denyal of him come in the fleſh, to make him ſo exact in Forms. And yet ſomething of Form he hath left us too, we being not yet come to full age, to perfection in knowledg and fulneſs of Spirit, but much carnal yet. And I acknowledg and beleeve, that what Ordinances he left us we are not proudly to deſpiſe, ſlight, alter and change, as if needleſs
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:112427:11"/> to us, or matters to be ordered meerly by our wills; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to wait upon him in them, not ſetting up our Poſts by his Poſts, nor yet being more holy then God and Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ezeck 43.8.</note> and more ſtrict and circumſtantial then he hath been in preſcribing them to us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea I propound to Conſideration that paſſage, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1, 2. where it's ſaid, <hi>A Reed like a Rod was given to John, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſaid to him, Riſe and meaſure the Temple of God, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and them that worſhip therein; but the Court that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Temple caſt out, and meaſure it not, for it's given to the Gentiles.</hi> By the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> is plainly in the Scriptures meant the Church in union and fellowſhip with Chriſt by Faith and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as he is the Altar and Sacrifice, and they that worſhip in it are the particular Saints worſhipping and adoring God in the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sacrifice of Chriſt, and in the unity of Spirit with Chriſt and one another; that's the Temple worſhipping: Theſe are to be <hi>meaſured with a Reed like a Rod</hi> or Scepter; theſe are to be cared for peculiarly, and the proportion of them diligently to be taken, both Temple and Worſhippers; God will not have an inch of them loſt, nor will he have any defect or redundancy in this ſpiritual Worſhip; according to this men are to be reckoned of, accounted and eſteemed the <hi>Sion</hi> of God. By the <hi>Court without the Temple,</hi> is meant that into which all the people come, (for it's an evident alluſion to the Temple of old,) the external outward profeſſion with the things of it, the worſhip of external Services or Forms; this is not to be meaſured, with ſuch exactneſs to be inſiſted on and proportioned to the true Worſhippers, as if they were to be known, or men to be reckoned ſuch by that, but to be left out as given to the Gentiles, the prophane Heathen in hearts; it's given to them to come in thither, to have the Name of Chriſt, and of the outward Court, whence (as thoſe things that were done in the outward Court were ſaid to be done <note n="*" place="margin">2 Chro. 6.24. Pſal. 12 2. with Luke 1.10.</note> in the Temple) <note n="†" place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>Antichrist is ſaid to ſit in the Temple of God;</hi> namely, in the outward Court of external Profeſſion, yea in every various Form, trampling under feet the <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of God. And it's conſiderable to me, whether all the ſtir and hurly-burly about external Forms and outward Ordinances, is not mens endeavoring to meaſure the outward Court, and to take it from the Gentiles (that worſhip not at the Altar and in the Temple) to whom yet
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:112427:12"/> it's given: and if that be not, what it is I would be willingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I conſider, that things not plainly expreſt in the Scriptures by way of Precept or Example, may yet be couched therein; and the truth and lawfulneſs of things may be rightly deduced from places that plainly in words affirm them not. As for inſtance; Chriſt proves out of the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Sadduces</hi> (who are ſaid to have accounted no part of the Scripture Canonical but them) that the dead ſhall riſe again; whereas in all thoſe Books there is not one expreſſion of the dead riſing: He proves it as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the bowels of that ſaying of God to <hi>Moſes, I am the God of Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 22.32.</note> 
               <hi>and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle proved from the Scriptures the needleſſneſs of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion to the beleeving Gentiles, though there is not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion openly ſaying it through all the Prophetical Writings; but he ſhews it by conſidering the ground and end of Circumciſion, and ſome other truths of Scripture whence he deduces it. The like may be ſaid of womens partaking of the Supper, and a Chriſtian man being a Magiſtrate. Yea the very Denyers of Infant Baptiſm take, or pretend to take, this courſe in what they ſay againſt it. For there is not (as we ſaid before) one expreſs ſaying, that Infants ſhould not be baptized, or that none but Beleevers actually, or ſuch as profeſs Faith and Repentance ſhould be baptized; or that all rhat were baptized, did ſo beleeve or profeſs: only they ſpeak of ſome Inſtances of former practiſe of the Apoſtles baptizing ſuch, from whence they draw thoſe deductions, and with which they make a great noiſe, and eaſily take ſilly women and ſimple people that cannot ſee into the Scripture depths, nor well underſtand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon according to Scripture: Though they may exclaim againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions in others, yet they are full of them themſelves. It's not ſaid <hi>(in terminis)</hi> Baptize Infants, or that the Apoſtles did ſo, therefore they may not be baptized; which is but like that, It's not expreſt that women received the Supper in the Apoſtles times, or that Chriſt inſtituted it for them alſo, therefore they ought not to eat of it: Or that of the Sadduces; <hi>Moſes</hi> no where mentions the Reſurrection of the dead in all his Writings, therefore from his doctrine it cannot be proved.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Things couched in Scripture grounds, and thence deduceable, are no leſs truths or warrantable then truths plainly expreſſed. As
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:112427:12"/> it's as very a truth couched in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Writings, that <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo the dead, ſhall ariſe, as it is in the Apoſtle's plain ſaying it, though not ſo eaſily by every one perceived. And ſo, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is a truth as really couched in the Prophetical Writings, as if it had been in ſo many words expreſt, though there is no ſuch plain expreſſion in all the Prophets. The like may be ſaid for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Faith without the Works of the Law, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath thence gathered and proved ſubſtantially, though ſuch an expreſs ſaying is in none of them Scriptures to be found. It's true, by the Apoſtle they are made evident to be truths, but not made truths by his evidencing them; they were there couched and contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſearching them and bringing them out, nay they could not rightly have been deduced thence, if they had not formerly been there couched. Now they that ſee not the truths couched in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor pierce to any truth but what is plain in the ſaying, they cry out that ſuch things are falſhoods that they cannot there ſee; not becauſe they are ſo, but becauſe they ſee them not as they lie there couched. As the <hi>Sadduces</hi> clamored againſt the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that their doctrine of the Reſurrection of the dead was an Error, not delivered to them from God by <hi>Moſes</hi> their Lawgiver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not ſee it in his Writings, though there it was, and there Chriſt found it: and as the falſe Apoſtles clamored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Paul,</hi> about the doctrine of Juſtification by Faith without the Works of the Law and Circumciſion, upon the like grounds, and with as little reaſon. And this Conſideration might at leaſt ſtop the clamorouſneſs of men, that, with the fool,<note place="margin">Prov. 14.16.</note> rage and are confident upon this ground, meerly that the Scripture hath no ſuch open and manifeſt expreſſion, leſt by their raſhneſs they deny truth contained more hiddenly in the Scriptures, and trouble the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God needleſly, as the <hi>Sadduces</hi> did. I grant, it's true, that there is no truth couched in Scripture, and thence to be deduced, that doth contradict or evacuate any plain expreſs truth of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: any collection from Scripture contradicting the open ſaying of Scripture, is to be rejected as not rightly deduced; for the Scriptures, though in ſome places they may ſeem, yet in no place doth deny or contradict it ſelf in other places: But many truths are couched in Scripture, that are not ſo openly expreſt in plain ſayings as ſome others be, as we before inſtanced. I conceive if thoſe called Anabaptiſts did ſeriouſly conſider this (and yet this is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:112427:13"/> as plain and undenyable a Truth as any can be pleaded for) it would make them more ſober towards others in this point of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm, and not ſo vainly to vapor, and ſo proudly to inſult, as ſome of them do in their own conceptions of the undenyable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this ground for denying it, <hi>viz.</hi> that it's not plainly expreſt in any Scripture Inſtance or Precept.</p>
            <p>And now let us in the next place ſee if any ground for it may be found couched in the Scriptures: and therein firſt of all let us view the Commiſſion given by Chriſt to his Apoſtles for Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Commiſſion we find in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>All Power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me, go ye therefore diſciple ye all the Gentiles, baptizing them into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, &amp;c.</hi> Where, firſt, we have to be noted, the ground of this Commiſſion, in Verſ. 18. <hi>All Power is given to me in Heaven and Earth;</hi> that is, Though as the eternal Word I had all Power over all Creatures before, they being all made by me, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.2, 3 <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. yet could I not with conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with my Truth or Holineſs order all of them, or any of loſt mankind, as now upon the account of my Death and Reſurrection I am in the nature of man impowered to do: had I not dyed and riſen for men, I muſt have deſtroyed them all for ever; but as vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually upon this account before, ſo actually now and in the nature of man am I inveſted with Power and Authority, as of Lordſhip over all Creatures, to order and diſpoſe them as I pleaſe agreeable to my Fathers Will; ſo over Mankind, to help and ſave them, and make all things ſubſervient to my deſigns about them: Therefore alſo have I Power to make new Orders, and grant out new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions what and to whom I pleaſe, as alſo to protect and defend them that I employ in the execution of my ſaid Orders and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions: Therefore I command, require and commiſſionate you to be my Servants and Meſſengers in the Work that I pleaſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn you; <hi>Go ye therefore.</hi> And further, For as much as by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of my Death and Reſurrection for all men, I have ranſomed all men, even all the Nations of the world out from under the power of the ſentence to death and condemnation, to which the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, broken by <hi>Adam</hi> as ſoon as made with him almoſt, did bind them over; ſo as that now, that Sin and Law notwithſtanding,

No other being to be baptized, but ſuch as were of the viſible Church of God before, Children of the Kingdom, upon whom the name of God was called, and ſo baptiſm was not to them the way of taking into the Church and Kingdom of God, but for further inſtructing, and taking in further them that were ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in it before: for that's clear that the people of the <hi>Jews</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:112427:14"/> were already in the viſible Church, the Vineyard of God, and Children of the Kingdom, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.12. &amp; 21.42, 43. <hi>The hedg was yet about them, and the clouds rained upon them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (not fore-proſelited and circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) baptiſm was the way of taking them in, and declaring and owning them to pertain to the Church: nor do we read of any <hi>Gentile,</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> coming into the viſible Body and Company of the Church, to be accounted of them by any other way or <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of outward inſtitution after Chriſt's reſurrection, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion being not practiſed upon them and theirs in their admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as was formerly uſed in proſeliting them. Indeed that the falſe Apoſtles ſtood for, and would have had the way of their entrance and admiſſion ſtill: in which two it is obſervable, that they make no mention of circumciſing their infants, but that they, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ought to be circumciſed, as was the manner of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> ſays, <hi>They conſtrain you, and would have you to be circumciſed, Gal.</hi> 6.12, 13. not mentioning infants, and yet it is certain that it was the manner of <hi>Moſes</hi> to circumciſe the infant male of all that came in, and ſo by that rule they are included under the words <hi>You,</hi> and <hi>Diſciples</hi> alſo; they were reckoned as parts of them in the external profeſſion. A man might as colourably wrangle and plead that the falſe Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired only the circumciſion of the actual believers of their <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and not of their infants, becauſe they never mention their infants, and becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>But they deſire to have you cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed;</hi> as that they baptized ſuch only, and not infants, becauſe there infants are not expreſt in the mention making of their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. If the Apoſtle include their infants in the word <hi>[you]</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the way of admiſſion into the Church which the falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles pleaded for, then I ſee no reaſon or colourable ground to exclude them, when they ſpeak of the way in which the true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did admit them. Nor find I any ſuch argument uſed by the Apoſtle againſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> circumciſion (which yet were it as the Antipedobaptiſts ſay, would have been a good one) as this, <hi>viz.</hi> that in caſe we admit circumciſion according to the cuſtom of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then we muſt bring in infants too into the Church again, which are as uncapable of being members of the Church now, as dogs or ſwine, (as ſome of the Antipedobaptiſts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112427:14"/> are ready over raſhly to ſay,) this would preſently have ſtruck the nail on the head; for they that were according to the will of God circumciſed, were taken thereby into the Church of God, the Kingdom of Heaven, according to the outward viſible Court. Had this been a known principle or maxime amongſt the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of Chriſt, and had Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught them ſuch doctrine, as that children are to be no part of the Church inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, there had been no ground for the falſe Apoſtles to have ſtood upon circumciſion after the manner of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And no doubt but the Apoſtles would have made uſe of ſuch an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them, had there been ſuch a Maxime, ſeeing it would eaſily and evidently have confuted them, and ſerved to ſettle the Church in peace in that hot contention. The excluſion of children from admiſſion into the viſible Church, would have broken in pieces the ordinance of circumciſion, that appointing all the male children to be circumciſed, and ſo to be admitted into the viſible Church with their parents. The general ſilence of this argument againſt them in ſo hot a conteſt, and when the Apoſtles writ ſo much to the believers to ſettle their minds againſt circumciſion, and its doctrine, as alſo of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and falſe Apoſtles, taxing the Apoſtles with caſting out, and rejecting children, is to me as good or better an argument to prove that there was no ſuch Maxime, as the excluſion of infants from the viſible Church, then the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſilence of infants baptized is to prove that there was no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants admitted by baptiſm. But to return to the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for diſcipling the <hi>Gentiles, Go, diſciple all the Gentiles, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Anti-pedobaptiſts find two Arguments here to exclude children.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our Saviour ſays, they are firſt to be diſcipled before they be baptized, and that children cannot be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the word <hi>them,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>them, Diſciples.</hi> Of theſe two things I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they make a great noiſe, but when they are examined there appears no cauſe for it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the firſt it may be ſaid, not only, 1. The order of words is not always the order of actions therein ſpoken, for if ſo, then <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:112427:15"/> baptized before he preached (which they will in no wiſe admit:) For it is ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. <hi>That John was in the wilderneſs bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing and preaching the baptiſm of repentance.</hi> If the order of words ſhew the order of actions, then <hi>John</hi> baptizing before he preached the doctrine of baptiſm, baptized ſome that did not believe that doctrine; for how ſhould they believe it before it was preached, and ſo by that way of arguing they get nothing, and yet this they often make uſe of, as again in that of <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> See, ſay they, believing is before baptizing, no man muſt be baptized till he have firſt believed, not conſidering that by the ſame way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, men muſt firſt confeſs with their mouth to ſalvation that Chriſt is the Lord, before they heartily believe to righteouſneſs that God hath raiſed him from the dead; becauſe ſuch is the order of words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If thou confeſs with thy mouth that Jeſus is the Lord, and believe in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> And yet who ſees not that that ſhould be a vain confeſſion of his Lordſhip, and not to ſalvation, as <hi>ver.</hi> 10. that proceeds from a heart, not firſt believing that Lord. And by the like way of reaſoning, when our Saviour ſays, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Other ſheep I have that are not of this fold, them muſt I alſo bring, and they ſhal hear my voice;</hi> becauſe he firſt mentions bringing them, before their hearing his voice: it ſhould follow that they muſt firſt be brought by him, (namely, to that fold, as follows, <hi>and there ſhall be one fold, &amp;c.</hi>) before they hear his voice. Well then, let us ſo take it, but by what manner of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt they then be brought by him to the fold, that is, to his Church, whereof his Diſciples were the members: if not by cauſing them to hear his voice, for that follows after their being brought, (though uſually to that he himſelf goes out to them with his ſervants, to call and bring them in, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.3, 4. with <hi>Luke</hi> 14.21.) then ſure it is by his ſervants baptizing them in their infancy, before they be capable of hearing him, for by what other action men ſhould be brought to his fold before hearing him, I cannot tell, and if that be the action to go before, let it paſs for an impertinent place to our buſineſs, but ſo we ſhall get much more by the bargain, if not, let them ſhew us how elſe he brings them before they hear him, or elſe quit this manner of reaſoning from the order of words. But I ſay not only this may be replied to it: but alſo,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:112427:15"/>2. It's not true, that Chriſt bids them make them Diſciples firſt, and then afterward baptize them. For the words are not <hi>going Diſciple and baptize,</hi> but <hi>going Diſciple, baptizing, &amp;c.</hi> And it is uſual in ſuch manner of ſpeaking, for the Participle to declare the manner of or ſome mediate act unto the thing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the precedent Verb: as to give ſome inſtances. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.11. ſayes of the Circumciſion, <hi>That they ſubvert whole houſes, teaching things that they ought not, &amp;c.</hi> was not <hi>teaching things they ought not the way by which they ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whole houſes?</hi> not that they firſt ſubverted them, and then taught things they ought not; but firſt taught things they ought not, and then, yea thereby, ſubverted them: ſo in the ſame <hi>Chapter,</hi> deſcribing a Biſhop, he ſays, <hi>He muſt be blameleſs as the Steward of God, not ſelf-willed, &amp;c. a lover of good men, ſober, juſt, holy, temperate, holding faſt the words of life.</hi> Will any rational man ſay, that he muſt firſt be all thoſe things before he hold faſt the word, or rather, that this is the way to be all that, holy, blamleſs, juſt, &amp;c. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Let us run with patience the race ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus.</hi> Muſt men firſt run with patience before they look to Chriſt, or rather is not this looking the way and means to that patient running.

So when its ſaid,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:112427:16"/> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29. <hi>The Publicans juſtified God, being baptized with the baptiſm of John,</hi> ſay they, not thence that the being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed was the way in which they juſtified God. I might mention alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.3. <hi>Saul made havock of the Church, entring into every houſe, haling out men and women, and committing them to priſon.</hi> Could we not have underſtood ſuch a ſpeech as this, Go, proſelite the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> circumciſing them, teaching them to obſerve all the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> And can we not in like manner underſtand this, <hi>Go, diſciple all the Gentiles, baptizing them, and teaching them to obſerve all things, that I have commanded you.</hi> Diſciple them in this way, <hi>viz. Baptizing them into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, and teaching them to obſerve what I have commanded you.</hi> So that its evident, that the phraſe <hi>diſciple, Baptizing,</hi> holds forth, for infers at leaſt no ſuch underſtanding of what is ſaid, as that they ought firſt firſt to be diſcipled, by teaching and brought to actual believing that were to be baptized with water by them.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond, that the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Now theſe two main Fortreſſes of the Antipedobaptiſts being

               </gap>, all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were to be diſcipled by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and inſtruction. So that this word is as large as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, to include women to the Supper, to include children to this diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling, and baptiſm; for there is no doubt but there were children too of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Heathen;</hi> and of them there is no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or excluſion. <hi>They were to bring into the houſe all that they found,</hi> as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.9.10.

And this agrees with, and is confirmed by, yea, and in part is grounded upon that truth delivered by the Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19 where the Apoſtle writes the Commiſſion given to them of God, with the reaſon and end of it. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was in Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world to himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes to them, and hath put in us the word of reconciliation.

Follows it, that then the Apoſtles then, or the Goſpel-preachers now, had nothing elſe to do for putting that Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in practiſe, but outwardly to baptize; for they had ſomthing to do to bring them that were not of themſelves acquainted with this, and that were naturally averſe to it, to be willing to yeild up themſelves, and their children to walk in this way, and follow after this Name unto which they were to baptize them: They muſt uſe perſwaſions perhaps to Kings and Rulers, not to uſe their power to reſiſt their diſcipling of their Subjects to this Name, and to ſubject themſelves, and all their government to it, and ſo to Maſters of Families, and Parents, to yeild up themſelves unto this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:112427:18"/> Name to be baptized unto it, and to obſerve the things of it, and yeild up their little ones alſo to be brought up therein; for that's plain they were to take none away by force from under any of their parents, but as they yeilded up themſelves, or was yeilded up to the inſtitution and nurture of the Lord by them: yea, in that it's ſaid, <hi>Diſciple, baptizing them into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> it's plain enough, that they were to declare and unfold that Name to men that they might know whereto they baptized them, and theirs, and to what they were to inſtruct and bring up their children, which to men grown muſt be before baptizing them with water, as was the conſtant practiſe of the Diſciples formerly, and of our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. yea, and of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> too in proſeliting men to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, though they proſelited their children alſo with them. But this Objection implies, that the framers of it thought there was none but Infants in the world, and ſo none that could or would oppoſe their endeavours to diſciple them, when Chriſt gave out this Commiſſion; or that this Baptiſm was not for diſcipling them to the Name of Chriſt, and ſo to be done as a means to bring the parties baptized to be ſubject to his Government, externally at the leaſt, and to profeſs his Doctrine; nor minded they what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the Commiſſion, that they are to teach them too to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Chriſt's Commands, as of old the Proſelites, even after Circumciſion, were to be taught thoſe of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But for ſeeing better into this, let us conſider a little the force of the word <gap reason="foreign">

But whether that be all the truth, I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing the word is never otherwhere uſed in that Neuter ſence, I propound it to conſideration whether we might not as well tranſlate it, <hi>He alſo</hi> (though ſecretly) <hi>diſcipled to Jeſus:</hi> that is, was ſuch a Diſciple as that he alſo drew in others with himſelf to him: but which way ſoever we read it, its neither any thing for or againſt the buſineſs we have in hand, only I thought good to note it.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112427:19"/> in their baptizing them, though that was one act in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it. The very bringing them into the Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſubjecting them to its nurture and inſtructions, is a diſcipling them, as appears by <hi>Luke</hi> 14.21. where this Commiſſion is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in other terms, and for <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, bring them in hither; and the opening the leſſons and myſteries therein to be taught, is ſtill a diſcipling, or making further Diſciples; though that be done by many ſteps and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as they are able to receive it, till they come to be perfect men in growth and underſtanding: and even then they are but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, diſcipled ones too, as we before noted. Whence it appears, that the Apoſtles and Goſpel-Preachers now have more work then the objection ſuppoſes: but yet in our uſual ſpeaking, the ſubjecting people to the School of Chriſt, or to the Church-ſtate, Nurture and Government, is a diſcipling of them; as we call the bringing a child to ſchool, and to the care, government, and nurture of it, the making him a Scholer: And ſo in that <hi>Acts</hi> 14.21. its applyed to the firſt ſubjecting men to the way of Chriſt, as it muſt of neceſſity have that in it too in this <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. Now the Apoſtles were about this work of diſcipling in all their preaching, and whole imployment; they were endeavouring to diſciple, though yet in their teaching, and holding forth the Goſpel only; they are not ſaid to have diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled thoſe that rejected it, though they held it forth to them: But its called diſcipling, as with reference to, ſo when accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with this effect of bringing men into the Church of Chriſt, and ſo putting upon them <hi>the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and upon ſuch their Commiſſion was actually, and more or leſs effectually put in execution and practiſe: and ſuch were denominated uſually <hi>Diſciples,</hi> a word too of a large latitude in its ſignification, as the word <hi>Scholer</hi> is, for we uſe to call him a Scholer that is put to ſchool, and him that hath begun to learn, though primarily it ſignifies ſuch a one as hath received, underſtood, and hath attained to ripe knowledg of the things that have been taught him. So in Scripture they that profeſſed the Doctrine of Chriſt, and ſubmitted to be his followers, and to learn of him, are called his Diſciples, though yet very rude and raw; yea, we read of ſome that have that Name given them, who yet know not the Alphabet of Chriſtian
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:112427:19"/> Religion, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.3. knew not what they were baptized into, viz. <hi>to believe on him that came after John, nor had ſo much as heard</hi> (by their own confeſſion) <hi>whether there was a Holy Ghoſt, or no.</hi> And ſome that turned back from him, when they came at an hard leſſon are called Diſciples till then, <hi>John</hi> 6.64. <hi>Though yet a Diſciple indeed, is one that continues in Chriſts word, John</hi> 8.31, 32. <hi>and denies himſelf,</hi> to that purpoſe, in the exerciſe of, or leaning to his own reaſon, where it croſſes Chriſts inſtructions, and the following his own deſigns, affections and will, where it hinders the practiſe of his teachings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24.</p>
            <p>Now whether that Name ever include Infants, may be a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. In <hi>Acts</hi> 11.26. its ſaid, <hi>The Diſciples were in Antioch firſt of all called Chriſtians.</hi> Its very probable, that they called all brought up in the nurture of the Lord, and who thereby were diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the world, Chriſtians, as the followers of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were from their very youth,<note place="margin">So the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the name Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, the chidren, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led papiſts to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And the <hi>Phariſees</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled others to themſelves, whom they called alſo Proſelites, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.15. And yet it was their manner to proſelite little Babes too with their Parents. Now that Chriſtians alſo were, and are to bring up their children indefinitely, in the way and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, is plain in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.4, 5. Again in <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> under the name of <hi>Diſciples, upon whoſe neck the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles would have put the yoke of Circumciſion,</hi> comprehends their Infants; for its a known thing that they would have had their children circumciſed in Infancy too, for that was the manner of <hi>Moſes. Why tempt ye God,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in putting a yoke upon the Diſciples necks, which neither we, nor our Fathers were able to bear?</hi> Nor matters it whether the falſe Apoſtles preſſed Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion upon others, then Diſciples, perhaps they might endeavour too to circumciſe the unconverted and unbrought in <hi>Gentiles;</hi> yet that's more then is mentioned. Its to the purpoſe, that <hi>Peter</hi> pleads only the Churches cauſe, that were therein to be yoked, and that yoke was inevitably to fall upon the children of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers with them, who now ſhould have been brought up in the nurture of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to the obſervation of his Law; whereas otherwiſe, they were only to be under the yoke and nurture of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:112427:20"/> Chriſt; and he calls all thoſe in the Churches thus to be yoked Diſciples: Nor is that valid, that ſome ſay, that the act of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing was not the yoke, but the opinion of its neceſſity; for neither is that true, that the opinion of its neceſſity, was the yoke put upon their necks, that was rather put into them, then upon them, and made way for their taking the yoke. The yoke was the ſubjection to circumciſion, and the obſervation of the Law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, as ſo urged, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. and this they were to put upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, circumciſing them with that intention, and to that end, that they might be ſubjected to the Law in their after training up. Its true, they felt not the weight of the yoke put upon them, till they being come to underſtanding, ſaw the greatneſs and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, and began to carry it, but upon them it was put even in their Infancy, and as they grew up, they alſo felt it. Again, in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.30. its ſaid, ſome would <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, whole houſes, or families.</hi> Now that they ſhould always happen upon ſuch as have no children, in them is very abſurd, and fooliſh to conceive, and contrary to all experience: yea, that this eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lights upon the little children who knows not: For as for children or ſervants fore-principled and inſtructed, there they often fail, (though often they prevail with ſuch alſo) but for the little ones in the tuition of their Parents, and as yet but <hi>raſae tabulae,</hi> empty leaves, fit to have any form of inſtruction imprinted upon them, they are more ſure to be ſubverted and overturned from the right way, (in which they were deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be inſtructed) in the ſubverſion of their Parents from ſound Doctrine; and eſpecially this was true of that Sect of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion there in particular ſpecified, <hi>They ſubverted children too from the Chriſtian inſtitution to the Jewiſh.</hi> Again in <hi>John</hi> 9.28.

A great (if not the greateſt) part of the difficulty of the Apoſtles work ſtood in that, becauſe they knew not the Name they would have them ſtoop to; and the doctrine they would have them learn, was novel to them, they had much to ſay againſt it, as that their wiſemen, Fore-fathers, and Rulers, neither knew, nor approved it, and the reſt of the world would hate them for it, &amp;c. thence they were not, nor would be baptized unto Chriſt, till they had firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Doctrine. It was their being convicted of the truth, that made them willing to leave the world, and its doctrines, and become Scholers or Diſciples unto Chriſt, and to be initiated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Government and Teaching. But now its not ſo with children born to them that are diſcipled, their Chriſtian Parents are bound to bring them up in the nurture of the Lord, and they to receive it as they are capable, which alſo uſually they are apt to do, at leaſt ſo far as to the external profeſſion, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of Chriſt and his Name, if it be carefully, as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, put to them; and that profeſſion and acknowledgment with orderly walking, is as much, or more then divers of them had, whom <hi>John</hi> and the Apoſtles baptized, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.7.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.3, 4.</p>
            <p>Therefore alſo it ſeems to me a great abſurdity, to require that before-hand of them for their matriculating, diſcipling, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in that is urged upon thoſe that have been otherwiſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, and have much to oppoſe which they have not; and to bring an heap of proofs, inſtancing what ſuch ſo fore-principled did, to be a rule for thoſe that are not ſo. It is as inept as if they ſhould alleadg the <hi>Jews</hi> proceedings in requiring confeſſions, and acknowledgments of them that came unto them from the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> to ſhew that the like was requirable of their Infants before their Circumciſion; or like as if a man ſhould ſay, that becauſe God requires of grown men actual repentance, faith, and invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him to ſalvation; therefore he requires them of Infants too, and ſo that they dying before may not be ſaved: If God diſpenſe with their non-acting thoſe things through incapacity, and yet ſaves them, why ſhould it ſeem irrational that he diſpenſe with the want of ſuch acknowledgments, or with the want of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112427:21"/> thoſe things themſelves, to admit them into the outward Court of his Kingdom: If he diſpenſe with them for the greater, why ſhould we not for the leſs; eſpecially when we know he did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſpenſe with the want of thoſe things in them for admiſſion into the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, which yet were there required for their admiſſion into it, that were men of years; and we find no one ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of his, that he would have them excluded his Church or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom amongſt the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> Nay, his Commiſſion inſiſted on is in ſuch large terms, as do abundantly include them. The <hi>Jews</hi> never had ſo large a Commiſſion for circumciſing Infants as this is for baptizing them, though there be not ſuch expreſs mention of them herein: for all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> comprehends all Infants, male and female too, whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> were limited to males only; and whereas they were tyed to the eighth day at ſooneſt, that ſo they might have a Sabbath paſs upon them for their cleanſing; now they are clean at any time, thoſe uncleanneſſes and ways of cleanſing being done away in Chriſt, the Commiſſion gives power to do it to all in diſcipling them, though through the wickedneſs of the world rejecting the counſel of God, and refuſing to ſubmit to Chriſt themſelves, or to ſubject theirs to him, they cannot do it to all that their liberty and power extends to; but ſuch ſurely are guilty of reſiſting the Meſſengers of Chriſt, as either hinder them from diſcipling themſelves, or withhold and forbid their children.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, then it appears, that there is no need of ſearching after particular expreſs mention of Infants to warrant their baptizing; for when a man hath a general Commiſſion, what needs the particularizing the ſeveral branches in it to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a mans acting upon them? If, <hi>Let a man</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat, &amp;c.</hi> be warrant enough for womens eating the Supper, becauſe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is in it ſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive enough of the female Sex, why then ſhould not, Diſciple all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or all Nations here, be warrant ſufficient to diſciple Infants, baptizing them, &amp;c. ſeeing that word is every whit as comprehenſive of Infants? If a man ſhould ſcruple to baptize an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, or a <hi>Scotch</hi> man, becauſe he finds not thoſe Nations expreſt in all the Scripture, would not any man laugh at him, ſeeing the Commiſſion is to all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are part? Or when its ſaid, <hi>Chriſt died for all,</hi> would
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:112427:22"/> it not be a fond ſcruple to ſay, It's doubtful whether he died for Infants that dye in their infancy, or not? The like is, this to ſay, What warrant have we to baptize Infants now, when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is, <hi>Diſciple all the Gentiles, baptizing them?</hi> If a King ſhould ſay, Go into ſuch a Countrey, and ſubject all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in it to my Government, and protection, putting them into my Subjects faſhions, and way of living, it would be a vain thing to ſay, What ſhould little children be ſubject to him too, and brought up after the manner of his Subjects? Sure, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Inhabitants in, their Infants muſt needs be included, and be taken for ſubjects with them, and be brought up after his ſubjects faſhion. And now I hope, I ſhall not need to ſay much by way of anſwer to that Objection, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p n="2">2. Let us in the next place view the practiſe of the Apoſtles upon this Commiſſion: <hi>viz.</hi> in their baptizing the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> wherein I ſhall not have to ſpeak of their baptizing the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, (ſuch as thoſe in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. &amp; 8. for the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch were ſuch, elſe would they have ſcrupled eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, as afterward they did <hi>Peters</hi> with <hi>Cornelius</hi>) but of the unproſelited <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſuch as were not fore-brought into the limits of the Church viſible, which as yet the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was accounted, Baptiſm being as yet not the firſt admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the Church, as then reputed, but into the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt the Lord of it already come; for as yet the <hi>Jews</hi> were not unchurched, as yet the Apoſtles frequented the Temple, and Chriſts Diſciples joyned with them in obſervations of the Law, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.1. and 21.20.22, 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor as yet did the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples underſtand the extent of their own Commiſſion, but thought that it extended only to Proſelites of all Nations, till God opened the matter in a viſion to <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10. and let him ſee that all were as clean for his converſing with, and admitting, as the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites of the Circumciſion. They might go and preach to any man, converſe with any, and upon their accepting the ſalvation of God, it was to come upon them, and their houſes, as before upon the <hi>Jews, Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>God taught him to call</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>no one (of what Countrey, Nation, Age, Sex ſoever) common or unclean: He might kill and eat any of the four-footed beaſts, for they were all let down to him.</hi> Till this, I ſay, they ſee not the extent of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:112427:23"/> their Commiſſion. But after the relation of this the reſt of the brethren were convinced that God had given alſo to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> repentance unto life, &amp; now they began to put in practiſe their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Commiſſion; for now ſoon after this <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were choſen, and ſent forth to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and they endeavour upon the <hi>Jews</hi> rejecting to diſciple them: but upon their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling according to their Commiſſion, ſome falſe Apoſtles, or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers of the Sect of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> began to ſtir up a contention, and to trouble the Churches, preſſing upon them that they ought to circumciſe thoſe they diſcipled, <hi>Put a yoke</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> calls it) <hi>upon their necks, even the yoke of Moſes Law.</hi> About this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion then (<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> having begun, and made ſome progreſs in their <hi>Gentile-diſcipling</hi>) the Brethren ſent them to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to diſcuſs this buſineſs with the Apoſtles, and the Church there, that there might be unity amongſt them, where it was determined by letters that they needed not circumciſion to diſciple them, or upon their being diſcipled. After which we firſt read of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> baptizing, and the firſt inſtance we have of their baptizing after that Revelation to <hi>Peter</hi> of the extent of their Commiſſion, and after the deciſſion of that queſtion about Circumciſion, was <hi>Lidia,</hi> concerning whom the Holy Ghoſt gives an account of Baptiſm ſutable to the Commiſſion; for its ſaid, <hi>That ſhe hearing Paul, God opened her heart that ſhe attended unto the things ſpoken by him, and ſhe and her houſe and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were baptized:</hi> without the leaſt mention made of any of their hearing and believing, but ſhe only. After which ſhe ſays to them, <hi>If ye have judged me faithful</hi> (not if ye judg us) <hi>come into my houſe.</hi> Whereas if the reſt of the houſe were men of age, they might have as well queſtioned their faithfulneſs as hers, as being able, if unfaithful, to betray them to evil men as well as ſhe: but not a word of their believing or profeſſing faith; and I am ſure there is a word ſufficient to include Infants, or little children, except they can be proved not to be of the houſhold. Again, a little after, we find the Apoſtle preaching thus to the Jaylour, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thou in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy houſe:</hi> viz. as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were out of <hi>Egypt, Jude</hi> 5. from the wrath of God that he feared upon himſelf and his, upon the Earthquake, and from the refuſing <hi>Gentiles</hi> condition under darkneſs, and Gods diſpleaſure againſt them. However
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:112427:23"/> God might judg the reſt of the world, them and theirs that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Chriſt, yet he believing ſalvation ſhould come to his houſe, they ſhould be with him under Gods protection; they ſhould at leaſt fare much better for his ſake, as <hi>Potiphars</hi> houſe for <hi>Joſeph</hi> amongſt them. Upon that, <hi>He bringing them out, Paul preached to him, and to all his houſe,</hi> (which might include infants and children too, as well as <hi>Moſes</hi> his holding forth the Covenant to little ones too, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.1, 11, 12. and as its ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.22. <hi>That he teſtified the things of the Goſpel to ſmall and great:</hi> which words are uſed to comprehend the youngeſt infant, with the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man, and moſt decrepit, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.12.) And its added, <hi>That he, and all his were baptized ſtraightway.</hi> Its true, it's ſaid alſo, <hi>That he rejoyced with all his houſe, believing in God:</hi> but its remarkable, that the words <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>rejoycing,</hi> are both of the ſingular number, as agreeing properly to the Jaylors own perſon, and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, [houſe wholly <hi>verbatim</hi>] is ſuch as might be applyed to him, with his family, all coming into ſubjection to the School of Chriſt, though every particular of his houſe did not actually believe or rejoyce. As when its ſaid, <hi>All Iudah rejoyced, and all the people of the Land rejoyced,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not, that every one, little and great of them, were actual in that rejoycing. A man may be ſaid to do a thing with his houſe, or whole family, as to keep a Sabbath to the Lord, or to keep a Faſt-day to him, when yet every one in the family are not actually capable of acting to the Lord. We inſtanced before in <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.16. ſo 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.13. the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, houſe wholly, may be underſtood to mean, in behalf of them all, with himſelf brought under the Government and Protection of Chriſt: <hi>he, and all his,</hi> (as its expreſly ſaid) <hi>being baptized.</hi> Now a man, and all his, and a houſhold, are words large enough to comprehend infants alſo. We read alſo of the houſhold of <hi>Stephanus</hi> being baptized, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. From which places, we may note,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we read of more baptized, then are ſaid to have had faith, or to have profeſſed faith before baptiſm, or then can be proved ſo to have had or done; as was before noted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we have words large enough to include Infants in the inſtances of the Apoſtles baptizing; words as large for that as we have any to include womens receipt of the Supper. Yea, why may not a man hence argue thus, What the Apoſtles practiſed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112427:24"/> in baptizing is lawful to be practiſed now by us: but they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the baptizing of whole families, therefore ſo may we, preſuppoſing ſtill that we do nothing by compulſion, forcing the Goſpel on them that actually reject it. And if ſo, then their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants will fall under Baptiſm; except we can ſhew that they are not of a family, or that there were no Infants in any of thoſe houſholds baptized by the Apoſtles, or that Chriſt or they hath given us precept or example to exclude them in baptizing ſuch families as have them; none of all which I am ſure can be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that here is another Scripture including them. If it be ſaid, <hi>we cannot prove that there were Infants there;</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Where the Holy Ghoſt is ſilent, there it appertains not to us to inquire.</hi> I walk by that that is expreſt, I baptize but the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that that's concealed, I have nothing to do to ſearch for. If the Holy Ghoſt would have had me put exception in families, then would he ſome where by precept or inſtance have expreſſed that exception, or ground of exception; As that in caſe there be Infants, then the whole houſhold is not to be baptized; or none may be baptized, but they that firſt profeſs faith; but there is no ſuch command or paſſage in all the Scripture. But its ſaid, that theſe inſtances muſt be meaſured by other places, that relate their practiſe.</p>
            <p>To that I anſwer, 1. That there may be different practiſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to different occaſions. Beſides, this is the firſt we read of baptizing after the underſtanding of the extent of their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, except of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> where all in the houſe too were hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and baptized, <hi>Et primum in unoquoque genere menſura eſt reliquorum.</hi> And therefore not to be regulated by thoſe places, wherein baptizing was upon other grounds, and with leſs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of their Commiſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their practiſe in all places is to be meaſured by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and not by one another, where occaſions (as of ſingle perſons, and without families belonging to them) might alter the expreſſions about their practiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor is there any mention any where of their practiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it can be ſhewed, that they excluded Infants, much leſs about baptizing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and bringing them into the Church; ſo that thoſe exceptions avail not. Nor yet do make their being of a houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſimply the ground of their being baptized; for I confeſs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:112427:24"/> there may be divers in and of a houſhold, that in ſome caſe, that is, of poſitive refuſing to ſtoop to the Goſpel, may not be baptized; As an unbelieving wife, ſervant, or child grown, they are by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion to be won in, or elſe let alone. This ſpringing from the foreſaid ground of not forcing Ordinances upon men: but I make the grounds of their Baptiſm, the tenor of the Commiſſion that bids them diſciple all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and of the Goſpel, holding forth grace to all, one and other, no man being common or unclean in that reſpect in Gods account, but as they render themſelves ſo by their willing rejections of the grace tendred to them, with their being under the tuition of thoſe that profeſs faith, and ſubjection to the Doctrine of Chriſt, and the non-reſiſtance found in them, and the duty lying upon parents to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Whence it is to be noted, that its ſaid of the Jaylour, he, and all his, not all his houſhold, but all his were baptized; poſſibly ſome in the houſe might not be in his diſpoſe, but ſo many as were his were baptized. If any man ſay, its an act of force to diſciple an Infant; I ſay no, of no more force to baptize them to Chriſt, then to lay them in their cradles, or carry them in their arms; they have no will nor reluctancy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, ye may do with them what ye will: whence they are a pattern of right entring the Kingdom, <hi>He that receives not the Kingdom of God as a little child, &amp;c.</hi> They receive it as God, and his people order them into it, and in it. And for their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling by inſtruction, they uſually, if well educated, drink it in, and ſubmit to it better then others, as to the outward profeſſion at leaſt, as was before ſaid. And I find not that Baptiſm was ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to any that would ſubmit themſelves to learn the Chriſtian Profeſſion. For that frivolous objection of ſome, that they ſhew its againſt their wills ſometimes by their crying, Its not worth the anſwering; for by the ſame reaſon, we may ſay, that ſome of them that are dipped, finding the water cold, do ſhrink and ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in their going into it, therefore they are baptized againſt their wills too: not to mention the like carriages in Infants circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who yet when they came to years of underſtanding, owning what was in Infancy done to them, were never therefore reputed members of the Church, or Proſelites by compulſion. But I paſs from this alſo to another Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:112427:25"/>3. Though it be true, that we find no expreſs Command to baptize Infants, <hi>in terminis,</hi> or ſuch an inſtance of Infants bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, yet we do find by undeniable conſequence, that Infants in the language of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo of the Scriptures, were baptized; ſo that to that common demand, Where read we of any Infants baptized? we can produce an anſwer very demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative: And that is in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2, 3. <hi>Moreover, Brethren, I would not have you ignorant how that all our fathers were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cloud, and all paſſed through the Sea, and were all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized unto Moſes in the cloud, and in the Sea.</hi> I pray let it be well minded, <hi>All our Fathers,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, were baptized unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the cloud, and in the ſea.</hi> Search the Scriptures, and we ſhall find that amongſt theſe <hi>Fathers,</hi> there were many that when they paſſed through the Sea, and under the cloud, were but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, See for this the Hiſtory in the Book of <hi>Exodus.</hi> Firſt, in <hi>Exodus</hi> 10.8, 9. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> after ſeveral plagues poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and his people, for refuſing to let the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> go out of his Land, being perſwaded by his ſervants, <hi>calls for Moſes and Aaron, and bids them go, and ſerve the Lord:</hi> but would know of them, <hi>who ſhould go?</hi> To whom <hi>Moſes</hi> gave this anſwer: <hi>We will go with our young,</hi>

               </label> To which I ſay, by way of conceſſion, That that indeed was not the Ordinance of Baptiſm appointed by Chriſt as come in the fleſh for diſcipling men into the faith of him as ſo come, nor was it (that we find) called a baptizing them by <hi>Moſes</hi> in his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:112427:25"/> Writings, but yet by way of Exception, I ſay its much to the purpoſe. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scripture here, and the Apoſtle calls it <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and therefore it may not be denied, to have been truly Baptiſm, though not ſo inſtituted by Chriſt come in the fleſh, as that we have to treat of, ſo that ſtill our aſſertion is true in the Apoſtles lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which may not be gainſayed by us, that thoſe Infants were baptized.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yea, this Baptiſm is mentioned, and ſpoken of by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, as anſwerable to the Baptiſm the Believers and Churches of Chriſt received into the Name of Chriſt, as a priviledge anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this of the Goſpel-baptiſm, and a teſtimony of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour toward them anſwerable to what this Baptiſm is now to us, and upon that account partly hath it the Name of Baptiſm put upon it by the Apoſtle, his intent and ſcope here being to ſhew that thoſe Fathers were all partakers of like priviledges; yea and in ſubſtance of the ſame with the Churches of Chriſt now, only the difference was in way of Adminiſtration, thoſe Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Ordinances being adminiſtred by the hands of, or under the conduct of <hi>Moſes,</hi> theſe, nor by and from Chriſt himſelfe, come in the fleſh, thoſe typing out, or fore-ſignifying Chriſt then to come in the fleſh, theſe ſignifying and leading to confeſs him come in the fleſh, and the grace that is in him as ſo come, and held forth to us by him, which is the ſame grace (as well as the ſame Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.) that was pointed to by them, now more clearly witneſſed and held forth, then not ſo plainly. And indeed, if this be not ſo, that that Baptiſm was equivalent with, and anſwerable to this of ours, ſince Chriſt manifeſted in the fleſh, as to the ſubſtance of it, the Apoſtles argument as much as ours from it would be rendred invalid: For whereas he brings theſe inſtances of them to anſwer a ſecret objection (occaſioned by his diſcourſe in the preceding <hi>Chapter</hi> from his exhorting them <hi>ſo to run, as to obtain, and from his ſetting before them his own Example, how he kept down his body in ſubjection, leſt having preached to others, he himſelf ſhould prove, or become a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, Chap.</hi> 9.24.27.) That they were called by the grace of God, into the grace of Chriſt, and baptized into him, and ſo delivered from that ſtate of enmity, and irreconciledneſs, in which as <hi>Gentiles</hi> they before lay; yea, were under his conduct, guidance, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:112427:26"/> his Church and people obſerving his Ordinances, and taſting the ſweetneſs of his goodneſs, and therefore what need of their ſo running, as if they were in danger elſe to loſe the prize, or to be rejected of God again; the Apoſtle brings the Fathers of old as inſtances of people under like favour and priviledges, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſpenſations of thoſe times, baptized as well as they, and eating the ſame ſpiritual bread in ſubſtance and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with them, and yet God was diſpleaſed with many of them, as follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now they might eaſily have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed that the caſe was far different, that was no baptiſm in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of theirs, their priviledges were not like theirs, &amp;c. and ſo they might as eaſily have retorted the Argument in that manner, as the Antipedobaptiſts may to us, if there were not a truth in it, that that was to them as much for that diſpenſation; yea, the ſame with this to us as to the main matter or ſubſtance. We muſt either argue the Apoſtle guilty of a weak argument here, as to his purpoſe of proving them alike priviledged with us, and we not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our priviledges as obnoxious to diſpleaſure from God, in caſe of unbelief, or unworthy walking, as they, or elſe we muſt confeſs this to have weight in it for this buſineſs: <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe Infants though not baptized into Chriſt expreſly and immediately, yet were truly and really as to external baptiſm bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into the Doctrine of God then delivered concerning Chriſt, as we be, or the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were; they had that that carries correſpondency with, and was anſwerable to our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yea further, Its to be minded here, That all our Fathers, and ſo the Infants of them, I mean ſuch of them as then were but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, were baptized into <hi>Moſes,</hi> or unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is, had an obligation put upon them by thoſe their paſſages under the cloud, and in the ſea, to liſten, to obey, and follow after <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his Doctrine, what ever incapacity was in them in reſpect of years, and want of actual underſtanding, then while they paſſed through the ſea, and under the cloud, to apprehend, or have made out to them, either what they paſſed through, or what <hi>Moſes</hi> was to them, or was contained in his Doctrine. And ſo it clearly evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that Infants are not uncapable of being baptized into the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God, or Name, Authority, Faith, or Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:112427:26"/>
            <p>For firſt, That that is the meaning of that phraſe, I ſuppoſe is clear to any indifferent underſtanding, <hi>viz.</hi> that by being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into, or unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> is not meant, that they were baptized, dipped, waſhed into the perſon of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the matter of their baptiſm for that was impoſſible, but the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there, is of the ſame ſignification, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into, or unto the Name of the Father, and of the Son; ſo they were baptized into, or unto <hi>Moſes, Moſes</hi> being there as in other places, uſed to ſignifie <hi>Moſes</hi> his doctrine, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.29. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> So alſo <hi>John</hi> 5.46, 47. Though I will not deny but <hi>Moſes</hi> his authority as a Prophet and Conductor of them, authorized of God, is, or may be therein alſo ſignified.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, I ſee no reaſon but an Infant is in every whit as good a capacity to be baptized into, or unto Chriſt, as then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Moſes:</hi> Its all one in ſubſtance as to what concerns the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs requiring capacity, that was into the Doctrine and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God by <hi>Moſes;</hi> this, into the Doctrine and Authority of the ſame God by Jeſus: that was to be ſubject to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his Doctrine, and Inſtitutions, when, and as they grew capable; this into Chriſt, his Doctrine, and Inſtitutions, when, and as they grow capable. I think no man will deny, that children now are as capable of the outward act of Baptiſm, to be acted upon them, be it what it will be, whether to be dipt into, or have water poured upon them, as theſe Infants were then to be carried, or paſs through the Sea; and that they cannot now ingage as much to be ſubject to Gods Authority in Chriſt, as then to it in <hi>Moſes,</hi> or underſtand as much what the Goſpel ſayes, as what the Law ſaid then, and much what both alike; I cannot perceive what ground any man can have to deny, except they will ſay, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſpake more darkly and figuratively of Chriſt, but Chriſt more plainly and perſpicuouſly both of himſelf, and his Father. And if we get but this by this place, That Infants in <hi>Pauls</hi> own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage are capable of being baptized into a Name, or Doctrine, and thereby to be obliged to that Name and Perſon we have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I conceive not a little.</p>

            <p>I ſhall nextly conſider, what we find expreſſed by Chriſt about his will concerning Infants: where I ſhall paſs over that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3, 4. where Chriſt makes them our patterns, becauſe we have occaſionally ſpoken of it before, and ſhall meet with it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where again: that in <hi>ver.</hi> 6. is conſiderable, <hi>He that ſhall offend one of thoſe little ones that believe in me.</hi> Some are of opinion that Chriſt ſpeaks that of little children in age, and think Chriſt reckons them believers in him, becauſe they have no other hope or confidence, excerciſe no ſelfe care, ſelfe truſt, or diſtruſtfull thoughts of God, but are caſt upon him, and take ſubmittedly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:112427:27"/> what he orders to them; according to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.5, 6. <hi>Thou art my hope, O Lord, thou haſt been my truſt from my youth, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee have I been caſt from my mothers womb.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.9, 10. <hi>Thou didſt make me hope when I was upon my mothers breaſts, I was caſt upon thee from the womb.</hi> And as they are <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.13. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.5. numbred with the fearers of God, <hi>Yee that fear the Lord, both ſmall and great.</hi> And the ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing ſuch is the harming them, eſpecially by perverting them to vain hopes and ways. I confeſs I am not ſatisfied in that my ſelf, and yet I think there may be ſomthing in it, and the rather for that the next fore-going ſpeech doth certainly include little children, <hi>viz.</hi> when he ſayes, <hi>He that ſhall receive one ſuch little one in my Name, receiveth me.</hi> I know <hi>Beza's</hi> conception is, that by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is meant, <hi>one that humbles himſelf as a little child;</hi> and that he ſpeaks not there properly of children; but <hi>Luke,</hi> who is of better authority, ſays expreſly, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.48. that Chriſt ſaid that of that very little babe too, that he took in his Arms, and ſet in the midſt of them: <hi>He that receives this little child in my Name, receiveth me.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Mark</hi> 9.36, 37. expreſly, <hi>He that ſhall receive one of ſuch little children,</hi> (without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other foregoingly, but the child it ſelf taken into his arms) <hi>receiveth me.</hi> But I ſhall paſs that, and come to that that's more full, <hi>viz.</hi> that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.13, 14. where its ſaid, that our Saviour having in the former part of the <hi>Chapter</hi> anſwered thee <hi>Phariſees</hi> about Divorce, there were certain little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or infants, (in <hi>Luke</hi> 18.16. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſucking infants,) and its conſiderable, to what end they brought them; and how Chriſt entertained them, but chiefly, what he ſays of Infants, by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the end of their bringing, its in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>That he might touch them;</hi> but in <hi>Matthew, That he might lay his hands on them, and pray.</hi> Now the laying on of hands eſpecially, when joyned with prayer, is an Ordinance or Inſtitution in the Church of God, named after the Doctrine of Baptiſms, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. and therefore, if there be any ſtrength in their way of arguing, that from the placing of words one after another, as baptizing after believing, would prove, that believing is to be firſt found in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, before they may be baptized; then the ſame argument would prove that theſe Infants were formerly baptized; becauſe they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:112427:28"/> came for impoſition of hands, a right uſually following mens baptiſm too in the practiſe of the Apoſtles, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. and 19.5, 6. Nor can the ableſt Antipedobaptiſt give us any certain proof or demonſtration, or ought, beſides their own preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they were not.</p>
            <p>Indeed I find <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> uſed in Scripture, in theſe three Caſes: <hi>viz. In healing diſeaſes, Ordaining to office, and ſending forth to the work of them, and praying for the Holy Ghoſt, and his bleſſings:</hi> where its mentioned to the firſt intent of healing, its uſually expreſſed, either to have been to that end, or that that was the effect, as in <hi>Mark</hi> 5.23. and 6.5. and 16.18. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.40. and 13.13. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.8. in none of all which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces find we our Saviour joyning prayer with it: or that he bleſſed them he ſo healed. Only that inſtance of <hi>Paul,</hi> hath menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too of joyning prayer with it: nor is there any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing probability, that theſe came for healing to Chriſt, as ſome would conjecture, becauſe mention is made in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> of his healing ſome. For when there was any healing wrought in the things mentioned, its common for one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt or other to expreſs it; but none of them ſay any ſuch thing of theſe. Beſides, his diſcourſe with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> about Divorce, if not alſo ſome other, as thoſe in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. intervened between his healing acts, and theſe children coming to him. <hi>And he was alſo gone from that place where he had been healing, and come into the houſe, Mark</hi> 10.10. Beſides, its too ſimple a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that the Diſciples ſhould prohibit them upon that ground, for they could not be ignorant that children might ſtand in need of healing, and be as capable of it as other perſons; and its moſt probable that it was ſome conceit of the unfitneſs of Infants for ſuch a buſineſs as they came; for that made them rebuke thoſe that brought them: nor could it be for ordination to office, and therefore it was for the Holy Ghoſt, or ſome bleſſing of his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; yea, its plain it was for bleſſing, and that is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> to be a greater thing then Baptiſm. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm being but an outward witneſs to Chriſt, and the Doctrine of Chriſt, and a matriculation of them into the School of Chriſt, that they might be in the way of his bleſſing: whence to uſe the Argument that <hi>Peter</hi> makes uſe of <hi>a majori, ad minus: Can any forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptized, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:112427:28"/> have received the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi> So we may argue here, Shall Chriſt admit them to his bleſſing, and ſhall not we admit them to outward Baptiſm to be brought into his houſe, and to have his name put upon them, that they may be more in the way of his bleſſing? when he himſelf gives them that that follows after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> ſhall we deny them the former, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm having ſo large a Commiſſion for diſcipling and Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>But its ſaid by ſome that this was an uſe amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> to bring their children to Prophets, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> and holy man to pray for them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But if ſo, then ſure the Diſciples would not have been ſo againſt them, as to forbid them, if it had been an uſual matter of honour put upon holy men amongſt them; ſince they were not unwilling to have their Maſter honoured, I conceive its likelyer they had ſome unworthy, low, and deſpicable thoughts of Infants, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Maſters buſineſs, and care. Beſides, they that tell us of the foreſaid uſe, are fain to fetch it from <hi>Iſaacks</hi> bleſſing <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> bleſſing <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſons. Strange inſtances to tell us of fathers bleſſing their own children, to prove that people uſed to carry their children to Prophets for their prayers and bleſſing; eſpecially too to prove their carrying Infants to them when as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> both were men grown, or well towards it, when <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſed them; for <hi>Iſaac</hi> was but ſixty years old when they were born, and he was now grown old and dim-ſighted, ſo as he could not diſcern one from the other when he bleſſed them; yea, <hi>Eſau</hi> was wont to go a hunting, yea, and was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried too ſome time before this. And for the ſons of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> they could not be leſs then about twenty years old, for they were born to him before the years of famine came, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.50. two years of which were paſſed before <hi>Jacob</hi> came down into <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 45.11. and yet he lived in <hi>Egypt</hi> after his going thither ſeventeen years, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.28. Beſide none were bleſſed by them, or by Chriſt, but members of the Church viſible; And therefore, if that may yet be done, (as I think none can find ground to deny it) then they may firſt be made members of the viſible Church, that ſo it may be done unto them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For their entertainment. We find the Diſciples forbad them that brought them, and would not have had them come to Chriſt 'Tis likely, as we have ſaid, becauſe they thought it a vain thing,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:112427:29"/> and that Chriſt would not regard ſuch as they: but its remarkable how ill Chriſt takes it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>(valdè aegre tulit, Paſs.)</hi> he took it very ill, or was very angry with them: which ſhews Chriſts account of Infants, and great favour to them; as he did alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. And as God alſo teſtified his love and pity towards them in ſparing <hi>Nineveh</hi> upon that account, that there were ſo many thouſand Infants in it, and it inſtructs us into this, <hi>That Chriſt will not thank, but take it very ill at that man that ſhall under any pretence of piety, or otherwiſe, keep back Infants (or indeavour it) from that that's for them in his Kingdom, and that ſhould make us wary, leſt we alſo run into ſuch like errours about them to incur againſt our ſelves alſo his indignation.</hi> After this it follows, that he called them to him, &amp; ſaid, <hi>Suffer little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or the little childen, to come unto me, and forbid them not.</hi>

            <p>Sure here he approves mens bringing little children to him to be under his care and bleſſing, who came for all Ages of men, to lighten every one, and deſpiſeth none, no, not the leaſt, but came to ſave them: And how little children ſhould now be brought to Chriſt, but by bringing them to his Church and people, with and amongſt whom he is yet ſpiritually preſent, I cannot ſee. Note further alſo, that he calls their bringing them, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for its not ſaid, <hi>That there came little children to him:</hi> as if they came of themſelves, but <hi>they brought little children to him:</hi> ſo it is in all the three Evangeliſts; nor did the Diciples rebuke the children, but <hi>them that brought them;</hi> yet here he ſays, <hi>let them come to me.</hi> They not reſiſting, or rejecting his goodneſs, its reckoned to them as if they came and deſired it, though they in their own perſons, did not deſire it. Where we ſee confirmed what we ſaid before, <hi>viz. That thoſe things that are required of men of underſtanding, to receive his bleſſing, or an ordinance of his to be acted upon them, (as laying on of hands and praying, is an Ordinance of God) are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Infants.</hi> Men grown muſt come of themſelves, being convinced and perſwaded by the truth, or elſe they are not bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him ordinarily, or received into his grace; but here chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though but brought, are ſaid to come, and he accepts and bleſſes them. For ſo it follows, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.16. <hi>He took them in his arms, put his hands on them; and bleſſed them.</hi> Wherein its alſo to be noted, that he deals with them as with Diſciples;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:112427:29"/> for I find not that Jeſus bleſſed any perſons elſe, but them that were his Diſciples, in any other place that ſpeaks of his bleſſing, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.50.</p>

The Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> what's that? I anſwer, The Kingdom ſet up by the God of Heaven, in which he is King, and reigneth by Jeſus Chriſt, propheſied of long ſince to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the houſe of <hi>David;</hi> A Kingdom of which the <hi>Jews</hi> were the children, it was preached to, and the promiſe of it ſet before them, yea, they were educated under its Ordinances in part, and to the expectation of it in the more Heavenly things: The Kingdom more fully preached by Chriſt, and (in its privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, riſe, and growth, and its adminiſtration by Chriſt in the humanity, in a more heavenly way,) then nigh at hand, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be revealed, though not in its heighth of glory, and large ſpreading luſtre: This is the Kingdom of Heaven, of which there are divers ſtations and degrees of entrance into it, and divers manifeſtations of it. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There is the outward Court, the Church viſible as viſible, or as outwardly priviledged by God, and diſtinguiſhed from other people not in it: or if ye will, the Government that Chriſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth in adminiſtration of his Heavenly Ordinances and Rites, over men as viſibly ſubjected to the profeſſion of him, the Church-ſtate with its outward Ordinances, the Oracles of God, and his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:112427:31"/> Statutes, and Appointments. So the Church-ſtate of old among the <hi>Jews,</hi> was part of that Kingdom, that God through Chriſt, and for him erected: The Wiſdom of God had there his Houſe, and Pillars, Ordinances, and Proviſion, though leſs heavenly, and more carnal, then as now its ordered by Chriſt come in the fleſh; and therefore rather called the Kingdom of God, then of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.43. This Government in the hand of Chriſt come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more properly both, becauſe as of God ſo more heavenly, and leſs carnal, then that before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The inward and inviſible uniting with Chriſt by faith, and ſo the Government of the Spirit writing the Law in the heart: The power and priviledges injoyed in the inner man; <hi>in forgiveneſs of ſins, peace, joy, conformity to God, &amp;c.</hi> And this alſo is the Kingdom of God, the more inward, more heavenly, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part of it: and this alſo is held forth in the firſt, and the right receipt of the firſt, with all the documents thereof, and ſpiritual operations afforded therein, is the way to enter into this ſtep of it. For this is it into which men enter not but by regeneration: Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>The Kingdom of God, is righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.20. <hi>That conſiſts in power, &amp;c. Into this the believer is tranſlated out of the power of darkneſs, Col.</hi> 1.15. The other ſtep is more viſibly upon men that are in it, this more properly in them. They that are but in the former Regiment, may be caſt out, and often are for their unfruitfulneſs, not receiving its inſtructions, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Spirit therewith, as a little child, ſo as to enter into this more ſpiritual Government, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.12. and 21.43. that, or the Kingdom of God in that part of it, (for its but one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in all its Regiments, as the Temple of old was but one in all its Courts) being like a Net gathering all ſorts, and <hi>like a man ſowing good ſeed in the field, wherein alſo the envious man ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth tares, out of which all things that offend ſhall be gathered, Matth,</hi> 13.24.41.42.47. <hi>And like to the wedding made by the King for his Son, to which the bidden gueſts refuſing to come, all that could be met with in the high-way and hedges were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and brought, Matth.</hi> 22.1.9, 10. yea to that all have liberty to come as the way to enter into it in its higher ſteps, or more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Government, and Dominion. But now this ſecond ſtep is yet more holy, and into it may none enter but they that ſo have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:112427:31"/> received the grace of God, in what is held forth in the former, <hi>as to be made an holy Prieſthood unto God.</hi> The former hath Laws for its Ordering and Government, and in it is the power of Chriſt to order it, which all ought to obey, and be ſubject to in their ſeveral places and ſtations, as in other Kingdoms; but theſe are more viſible and outward, as <hi>Baptiſm, the Supper, Exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Teaching, Hearing, Prayer, Communion, Cenſures, &amp;c.</hi> As alſo ſubordinate Officers, <hi>Biſhops, or Elders, Deacons, &amp;c.</hi> Its Keys of Doctrine and Cenſures, its Publick Regiſter, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Book, the Scriptures, wherein its Laws and Orders are written and recorded. This latter hath its Laws, the ſame for ſubſtance with the other, but written alſo more inwardly in the heart, where the Spirit is more immediately Governour and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and ſupplies all grace to the ſoul alſo: Theſe have fellowſhip with God, and with Chriſt in ſpirit, and heavenly things, as well as one with another in outward Ordinances; which theſe alſo have (the inner Regiment being in theſe who are under the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, though not in all of them.) Theſe have the inward true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Baptiſm in the blood and price of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10 17.</note> 
               <hi>ſprinkling their conſciences, and making their hearts pure; and they feed ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually upon Chriſt himſelf, eat all of that one bread, and partake all of that one ſpirit in him.</hi> So as to be really and inwardly, (though myſtically and ſpiritually) one body, being baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it by the Holy Ghoſt, and made meet for the inheritance; as well as outwardly baptized, and outwardly eating the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of Chriſt, as the outward Regiment more generally do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is alſo beyond both theſe, a third ſtep, or way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment in this Kingdom, like unto the <hi>Holy of holies,</hi> that into which Chriſt himſelf is really entred, and all they that are in the ſecond form do enter by hope, but not as yet by real poſſeſſion. The Kingdom in Glory and Power exalted above all other: This is that which is yet to be manifeſted; <hi>Which Chriſt is gone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and which he ſhall come in, even in the Glory of his Father, and poſſeſs all his Saints that here have followed him faithfully withall.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:112427:32"/> 
               <hi>he ſhall be admired alſo in all his Saints,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1.10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>and they ſhall be glorified with him.</hi> In this all his, and their enemies, ſhall be put under them, and bow before them, even all that here have perſecuted, and hated them; and they ſhall be poſſeſſed of all the happineſs prepared and laid up in Chriſt for them, even their inheritance. The fulneſs of God, and glory, and perfect freedom from all the bondage of ſin and ſervitude, and from what ever did afflict and trouble them. And this ſtate of the Kingdom Chriſt ſhall come in, at his glorious appearance again from Heaven, when he ſhall raiſe up all his to meet him, and be ever with him: therefore alſo its coupled with his appearance, in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. This is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in its flouriſh and compleatneſs, as <hi>Solomon</hi> in his glory, when as the other two are but the tendencies to this, and like the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>David</hi> in the midſt of oppoſitions. The Keys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the firſt ſtate are committed to the ſervants of Chriſt, to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the other Apoſtles, with their ſucceeding Church-officers, and they may let in, or put out there, and when they walk in the Spirit in ſo doing, Chriſt approveth what they do, and admits too gracious operations of Spirit for bleſſing his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to them, or withholds his preſence from them as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or put out. But for the other two ſtates, the Key is only with himſelf, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.7. and into them none but he can give admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Whom he ſhuts out, to them none can open, and to whom he opens none can ſhut this ſtate againſt them. Into the ſecond, he admits by the ſpiritual Baptiſm thoſe that receive the grace of God held forth in the outward Court, (and witneſſed to by the outward Baptiſm) rightly and effectually, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11, 12. Thoſe that by the Word and Spirit accompanying it, are truly prepared for him, turned to him, to look towards him, and wait for him, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.16, 17. and 3.4. And theſe wait for, and ſhall in patient continuance inherit the third; into which no ungodly perſon, no chaff in the floor of Chriſt, none without the wedding garment though come into the houſe, none that work iniquity, though within the outward form and ſtate of the Kingdom, ſhall find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20, 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41, 42.</p>
            <p>And let this be noted, that though ordinarily when mention is made of the Kingdom of God, and of Heaven preached, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to be ſought and entred into, all theſe three ſtations of it are infolded in one another. As when its ſaid <hi>Paul or Chriſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:112427:32"/> preached the Goſpel of the Kingdom, or preached the Kingdom of God, &amp;c.</hi> yet as that they ultimately aimed at, was the bringing men to the Kingdom in glory, ſo that they moſt immediately, and nextly urged unto men to receive and ſubmit to, was the firſt ſtation, The coming into the Church-ſtate, and ſubmiſſion to Chriſt in his Government, Word, and Ordinances therein, as that which he ſet up as the <hi>Medium</hi> to bring them into union with himſelf, and ſo to participation of his glory; as the houſe in which his Feaſt is made ready, and in a Firſt-fruits in the regiment of his Grace and Spirit to be pertook of by thoſe that duly and rightly receive the outward Miniſtrations in his Church, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters where the Spirit moves for the renewing of thoſe that duly and ſubmittedly wait upon him, and waſh therein: The Bed of Love wherein the immortal Seed of the Word of God, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Covenant made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> is poured forth for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting children to him. Under the Regiment of Chriſt here all ought to come, all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are to be diſcipled, all, (ſo many as they found without choiſe, diſtinction, diſcrimination,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.8, 9, 10.</note> and limitation) are to be brought, and here under to be nurtured that they might enter the ſecond, into which yet none of theſe do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but them that intirely ſubmit to him therein, (as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.) <hi>Thoſe that obey him, Acts</hi> 5.32. <hi>the upright hearted, the poor in ſpirit, the righteous, they that bring forth the fruits of it, and they ſhall have an abundant entrance, Pſalm</hi> 84.11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.7. and 18.3. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. And going on therein ſhall be ſurely rewarded with the third, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.26, 27. and 3.34. and 3.21.</p>
            <p>Now how the words are to be taken here, appears by what is ſaid, and by what follows in the Text, <hi>viz. He that receives not the Kingdom of God as a little child, &amp;c.</hi> that receives not, in the preſent Tenſe. Now the Kingdom to be now received by us, is that that cometh now to us, and that is certainly the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt in his Word and Ordinances, as then to them miniſtred externally by Chriſt, and as now left unto us in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of his Servants, and by ſuch as he hath inſtructed therein, yet miniſtred unto us; with all the operations of ſpirit that come along therewith in convincements and teachings to fit us for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the inward regiment or priviledges of it in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, joy, peace, &amp;c. This was that that came to the <hi>Jews,</hi> or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:112427:33"/> nigh unto them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.2. and 10.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.9, 11. and 11.20. But they received it not, and ſome of them that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, yet not going on to receive it as little children with ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, humility, meekneſs, they could not enter in to the inward regiment, and its priviledges, but finding the entrance too ſtrait, turned back again from it, <hi>John</hi> 6, 60.64. and 8.30, 31, 34. &amp;c. The Kingdom as it ſhall come in glory hath no rules annexed to it about men's entertaining it, that I know of, but its evident, this of the external Miniſtration, with the ſpiritual operations afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith, for bringing us into the ſtate of ſpiritual union with Chriſt, hath, and we find that many could not become ſo far chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ſimplicity and ſelf-nothingneſs, as to receive it, it being as ordered by Chriſt every where ſpoken againſt, and we find yet that men not receiving the inſtructions of the Word of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as held forth to men in the Scriptures, in the reproofs and teachings of it, ſtick in the form of godlineſs; nay ſincerely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to that, muchleſs enter they into the inſide of this Kingdom, to have the Law writ in their hearts, and to experiment the peace and joy that is therein. Of ſuch is the Kingdom, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven, and of God. Nay, I know not how to exclude them right to any part of it, if we ſhall take it for the Kingdom in its Glory, as ſome do; for then much more ſhould they have right to any other thing in it, as they were capable of having it put to, and vouchſafed them, according to <hi>Peters</hi> arguing: But ſure he meant the Kingdom of God, as they had the Keys of it, or were to have; and ſo as they had power of taking in, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, ſuffering to come to Chriſt, or forbidding them: and as the bleſſings of it were to be obtained for, and imparted to them, through man's miniſtration: for it was not from the after-glory, or inward communication of ſpiritual grace that they went about to detain them, but from that diſpenſation of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which they were brought to Chriſt for, in an external way of miniſtration: And therefore it is meet that we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his Speech, ſo as may reprove and correct their thoughts in that for which he faulted them: As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven, which I preach, and am inſtructing you to be my Miniſters in, and which I am ſetting up, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering men into, is of ſuch as theſe Infants, or for ſuch as theſe whom you thus ſlight and reject, therefore forbid them not, but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:112427:33"/> let them come unto me, as to the great King thereof, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, therein to be bleſſed by me.</hi> As for the phraſe. <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That theſe children were not brought to Chriſt to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, nor did he baptize them, or bid his Diſciples do it, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>1</label> but he was angry with them for bidding them to come to him, becauſe they therein hindred the occaſion of his doing good to men, and becauſe the faith of the bringers was herein to be cheriſhed, and the power of Chriſt in bleſſing to be manifeſted, and the exellent Doctrine concerning little children being capable of the Kingdom of Heaven to be delivered: therefore no ground hence for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <p>It's true, theſe children were not brought for Baptiſm, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> but for ſomewhat higher then it; nor read we that he baptized them (for Chriſt baptized none with water himſelf) nor that he bid his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples baptize them, and whether they were baptized before, or not, in all the people, being baptized, its not certain; its not expreſt that they were, or were not: but he did that for which they came to him, and by that indeed took occaſion to ſhew his good will to men, and cheriſhed the bringers faith that thought he had bleſſing alſo for Infants, and eſpecially to open that Doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Infants capacity for the Kingdom, which ſhould be of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe to the Diſciples in ordering the Affairs of the Kingdom. Now upon Chriſts words, and ſpecially this his inſtruction toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:112427:34"/> with his after-commiſſion for <hi>Gentile</hi> Baptiſm, we ground the right of their Baptiſm. But for the cauſe of his anger, 'tis more probable it was their low thoughts of them; for their errour which he rebuked them for, is beſt to be underſtood by what he ſaith for correction of them, had his diſpleaſure been againſt them for letting him in doing good, or meerly cheriſh the bringers faith, &amp;c. His ſpeeches would have been to that purpoſe, they would have contained the ground of his rebuking them, as uſualiy in all other caſes they do. But now its evident they contain the freeneſs of his grace to children, and their capacity for the Kingdom, and by conſequence of his bleſſing, therefore their fault by in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, their too low thoughts of them, as if unmeet and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Chriſts care of them, and acting in his Kingdom miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards them. And no doubt but much of the wiſdom and goodneſs of God and Chriſt is herein to be ſeen, in ordering this providence, that ſo he might take occaſion to open his will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them unto us, in that which he foreſaw would be much queſtioned, and to order it to be ſo diligently recorded by three Evangeliſts, that under the mouth of three witneſſes, we might be more confirmed in childrens right to the Kingdom, and ſo by conſequence to Baptiſm that takes them into it, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges their right, and might not keep them out upon ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of them as the Diſciples had of them. As for theſe, it was not perhaps ſo material to baptize them, they yet being of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and ſo in the Kingdom by Circumciſion, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially now when neither he nor his Diſciples were about bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, nor they brought to him for that (which as we ſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they had received before.) Theſe things were done and ſaid rather for inſtruction to his Diſciples, for their after-carrying on the buſineſs of the Kingdom, then for their preſent information about them particular children. As uſually his Doctrines and Speeches to his Diſciples upon any ſuch occaſion had a ſpecial eye at their fitting for that buſineſs, and out inſtruction. All that diſcourſe in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. is plainly inſtructive to the Diſciples about things pertaining to the Kingdom, not only as at that preſent, but rather as it ſhould be ordered after his departure by them: the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that queſtion about Divorce, Marriage, and Continency, was plainly inſtructive to them too for ordering the Affairs of the Kingdom in thoſe matters too: and this about children follows
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:112427:34"/> very fitly for their direction and inſtruction about them, as alſo in the ſame order the Apoſtle gives hints of inſtruction about them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.14. I ſay not that the act of Chriſt then was a ſtanding rule for Baptiſm. But in his act doing that that is greater then Baptiſm to them, and in his expreſſions of the ground of it, &amp; inſtructions about it, he holds forth a fair intimation of his will, and ground of their admiſſion in the Church-ſtate for the future, as well as formerly they were. Sure its a far more evident intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that, then that ſaying, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> was of the reſurrection of the dead to any ordinary underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Commiſſion authorizing to diſciple all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them, and this telling us expreſly, <hi>That little children are not to be kept from coming to him, becauſe of ſuch is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> They together afford ſufficient foundation for their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling, and admiſſion into the Kingdom, and ſo for their Baptiſm. And I think, the words here are ſuch as might juſtly occaſion the Antipedobaptiſts to queſtion their way whether it will not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expoſe them to Chriſts indignation to deny admiſſion into the Kingdom to them, then any place they can produce give co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to deny it to them.</p>

            <p>But neither ſay I, that here is an expreſs command to baptize them, but a declared ground of their right thereto, and a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to hinder them that in faith bring them to Chriſt, ſeeing of ſuch is the Kingdom into which Baptiſm is an outward declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive admiſſion; and in prohibiting them to forbid their coming to him, is an intimate inſtruction to admit and let them come in to him; yea to further them therein. And I think none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the coming to the people, or Church of Chriſt, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their care, and miniſtration is a coming to Chriſt, in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; as of old, <hi>They that joyned themſelves to the Church of God, are ſaid to joyn themſelves to the Lord, Iſai.</hi> 56.3, 6. <hi>To Chriſt in his Church as there protecting, covering, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth life to men, the ſervants of Chriſt do call men, teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both to ſmall and great,</hi>

And yet when any man comes upon that call, whether of himſelf, or brought by others, as theſe were, ſhould we keep them out, and ſay, <hi>Oh no, the Kingdom is not for you, the grace of Chriſt is not for ſuch little ones, nor to be teſtified towards them by diſcipling them, and admitting them into the Kingdom, till they appear to be elect by ſhewing faith and repentance.</hi> We cannot tell whether there be any cover or protection here for them? Is not this to reject the teſtimony of Chriſt, that ſaith of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven? Is this to cheriſh the faith of thoſe that bring them, or do we not therein rather ſay, <hi>They erre in exerciſing ſuch faith, and ſo with theſe Diſciples rebuke them?</hi> Surely we therein fulfil not the Commiſſion that bids, <hi>Diſciple all the Gentiles, baptizing them.</hi>

            <p>That follows not: for its one thing to have the Kingdom gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, and ſo be admitted into it; and another to have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ordinance of the Kingdom.

            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, There is no ſuch injunction in all the Scripture that whoſoever comes to be baptized, ſhould firſt believe and repent, and then be baptized. Some indeed were baptized with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, <hi>That they ſhould repent, Matth.</hi> 3, 11. and <hi>that they ſhould believe, Acts</hi> 19.2. But its not ſaid, That a man muſt firſt believe and repent, and ſo be baptized, as laying that down for a general rule, as its in the other, <hi>to examine himſelf.</hi> Its again true, That <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking to perſons oppoſite to Chriſt, and his way, and capable of repentance, bids them, <hi>Repent, &amp; be every one of them baptized into the Name of Chriſt, Acts</hi> 2.38. but its to be minded again, That he ſpeaks to perſons that had actually reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt, and that could not nor would be baptized into his Name really, and in truth, <hi>Except they did repent of their evil thoughts of him, and carriages againſt him.</hi> 2.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:112427:36"/> or to be Diſciples to Chriſt.</hi> While they were ſo evilly affected to, or thoughted of Chriſt, they neither entred themſelves into his Kingdom, nor yeilded up theirs to it, but repenting, they would both be baptized into his Name themſelves, and bring theirs in with them, and ſo every one of them be baptized into the Name of the Lord Jeſus. This is that that he would have of them, and and therefore lays down a ſutable reaſon, <hi>The promiſe is to you, &amp; to your children, &amp;c.</hi> If they repenting had not yeilded up their children to Baptiſm, they had not been every one of them bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into that Name; ſo that that place may make more againſt ſuch a rule then for it.

            <p>But to that I anſwer, That (beſides the want of this <hi>verſe,</hi> wholly in five Copies, (it is obſerved by <hi>Beza,</hi> and others; and the omiſſion of it by the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Interpreters which doth ſome what weaken its authority) all that can be ſafely drawn from that expreſſion, is this, That it behoves men of years that come to Baptiſm, to be real, cordial believers of the truth of that Doctrine, that they deſire Baptiſm into, and not to diſſemble with God, and his ſervants, and deal hypocritically in what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give credit to. And that perſons ſo believing, be they of what Nation ſoever may lawfully be baptized. But its not ſafe to conclude thence, That no perſon till actually ſo believing may be baptized lawfully; that's more then <hi>Philip</hi> (if theſe were his words,) ever ſaid that we find Negative concluſions from ſuch Affirmatives, are not always ſafely drawn. As to inſtance, God ſaith to <hi>Abraham, If there were fifty righteous found in Sodom, he would not deſtroy it:</hi> yet we know it was not therein couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a truth, that unleſs there were ſo many he would deſtroy it, nor is it ſafe to conclude, that there were not full out ten righteous perſons there he would not ſpare it, becauſe he ſays, If there were ten ſuch he would; nor is it ſafe to ſay, that none but them that actually believe in Chriſt, and that keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments ſhall enter into life, and be ſaved, and ſo exclude all Infants as not actually capable hereof, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to the Jaylor, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> and Chriſt to the young man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>If thou wilt enter into

So that place ſhews but how perſons of age never fore-brought up under, nor fore-inſtructed to the Name of Chriſt, upon their being inſtructed into it, ought to come, but lays down no general rule for Baptiſm, as if none till ſo grown, and ſo believing, might be baptized; As the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Supper contains a general rule for thoſe that are to come to it, the ſpeech being not onely applicative to ſome perſons, as thoſe others are, but in the third perſon indefinite.</p>

               </label> 1. That I find no mention in Scripture of reprobate Infants rejected from the Kingdom, that we ſhould ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and repute any to be ſo, and upon ſuch a fear exclude them. As for that inſtance of <hi>Eſau,</hi> he was not in Infancy rejected from the Kingdom of God, at leaſt in its outward Regiment, or Church-ſtare; no, nor from poſſibility to enjoy the eternal ſtate of life, by any thing I can find. All that's ſaid of him while an Infant was this, <hi>That he ſhould ſerve the younger.</hi> And I am ſure to be a ſervant to Chriſt, and his Church, is not to be rejected from the Church, that's no more then is appointed to all Nations. And that was the thing that <hi>Jacob</hi> and his poſterity was choſen unto, to have the Kingdom ſeated in his ſeed and poſterity, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to have bleſſing in ſerving him, but curſe in deſpiſing and rebelling againſt him: as the Seed promiſed was of, and in him, and there to ſet up his Kingdom. As for the ſame reaſon all the other Tribes was to bow down to that of <hi>Judah, Gen.</hi> 49.9. and yet they were not therefore reprobated from eternal ſalvation: In this reſpect <hi>Jacob</hi> is ſaid to have been loved, not perſonally only, but Nationally in his poſterity, even to <hi>Malachies</hi> time; for in his time that was uttered, <hi>Jacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated, Mal.</hi> 1.2. That love to <hi>Jacob</hi> is brought to prove his love to them, called alſo by that name <hi>Jacob,</hi> even as <hi>Jacob</hi> alſo while in the womb is called the younger or leſſer people; that it might be evident that that was not ſpoken of his ſingle perſon only, as men uſually expound it, of a purpoſe of his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory, and <hi>Eſau's</hi> perſonal damnation: for that neither ſutes the Oracle ſpeaking of two Nations and Peoples, nor could be a fit convincement of his Poſterity ſo many hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that God loved them, not the purpoſe of <hi>Eſau's</hi> perſonal damnation be any manifeſtation of hatred to his poſterity, in whoſe times his Mountains were laid waſte: nor ſutes it with the Scope of the Apoſtle, who was not ſpeaking of Gods electing, or rejecting their perſons to eternal ſalvation, or damnation: nor perhaps of ſuch purpoſes there at all. But of his rejecting the Seed or Nation of <hi>Jacob,</hi> (formerly ſo loved) from being
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:112427:38"/> his Church and People through their rejecting the Goſpel, his earneſt wiſhes and prayers for their ſalvation, his endeavouring it alſo in the Goſpel-preaching; his ſaying, <hi>God could yet graff them in again, and that they ſtumbled not that they might fall,</hi> argues, That he judged them not under an abſolute decree of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation, but that he ſpeaks there of their breaking off from the Church in their viſible condition, See <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1. and 11.11.14.23. So that that Expoſition and underſtanding of it, is a meer miſtake of the Apoſtle, and Prophet. Sure <hi>Eſau</hi> had a birth-right, and by that right to bleſſing too, till he prophanely ſold it, and was in the Kingdom and Church of God, notwithſtanding that Oracle made known to his Parents till he threw himſelfe from it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Had this been the reaſon of Chriſts bleſſing of them, then was there leſs reaſon for his being ſo much diſpleaſed with his Diſciples,<note place="margin">

Beſides, this makes his purpoſe to bleſs them, the ground of the Kingdoms belonging to them, whereas he lays down their right to the Kingdom, as the ground whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he would have them admitted to his prayers, and bleſſings; and upon that ground was diſpleaſed with his Diſciples for hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their coming to him: yea, that would found the ground of ſimilitude between them, and ſuch others grown men as may enter the Kingdom, not in any thing in the children, but in his affection only to them, in which is identity or ſameneſs towards them and others, rather then ſimilitude; and ſo the after-inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is out of the way that ſpeaks of our receiving the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as a little child, not of ſecret purpoſes and intentions in Chriſt.</p>

Surely ſo far as God hath cleanſed, we ought not to account common Yea, God hath ſhewed us that we ought not <hi>to call any man common or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi> that is, As the Son of God, Chriſt Jeſus died for all, and riſen again, that they that live ſhould live to him; and as God hath to that end alſo made him Lord of all, and hath given all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him, even the utmoſt ends of the earth for his poſſeſſion: and hath given forth Commandment to publiſh in his Name glad tidings, even the Goſpel of his Kingdom to all, and ſent his ſervants in as much as in them lies, to diſciple all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (without exception) baptizing them into his Name, &amp;c. ſo bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into the obedience of his faith: So, did the whole world yeild to his gracious Proclamation, they might be into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom received, but ſuch as refuſe it, refuſe their own mercy, and chuſing to follow Satan, do abide in his Kingdom, and are out of Chriſts.

Profeſſed ſubjection to it is enough for our acting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men of years: For even ſuch as but profeſſed that, were by the Apoſtles evidently admitted, and that without ſtaying to ſee the truth of that profeſſion, as is plain in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and in thoſe that were baptized in the ſame hour,<note place="margin">Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.33.</note> that they heard the word firſt in, or very preſently upon it, they and their houſes; for any that profeſs that themſelves will (as it may be charitably conceived) be willing to bring up theirs in the ſame way with themſelves.

The Command for Baptizing lies not ſimply here, but in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. where all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are commanded to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, baptizing them; and that's a Commiſſion poſitive enough, large enough to include them, as large as to include women, or uncircumciſed ones, that's the Commiſſion for it; and this in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. inſtructs to the clearer underſtanding of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion with reference to children, that they alſo are to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Kingdom. And whereas its added, that this is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, that's not ſo; for here is the reaſon for their admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt, which the Commiſſion wills, <hi>viz.

            <p n="3">3. Divers other things meerly poſitive have leſs, or as little clear inſtitution by Chriſt, in any of his practiſes and ſayings.

If it be ſaid of women, <hi>That they are of the Body of Chriſt:</hi> ſo its ſaid concerning Infants, <hi>That of ſuch is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> The Kingdom being for ſuch, is as good reaſon for admitting them into it, as womens pertaining to the Body of Chriſt to admit them to the Supper to remember it. Yea, might we not as warrantably (againſt all the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctours) affirm, That no woman was to eat of, or did eat the Paſſover Lamb in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as that no Infant was, or may be baptized, becauſe that being a meer poſitive Ordinance, its never ſaid, Let women eat of it, or that they did: Nay its ſaid; <hi>None that is uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhall eat of it:</hi> And the Antipedobaptiſts ſay, Circumciſion reached only to males: And if it be replyed, <hi>That all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Iſrael was to keep it, Exod.</hi> 12.47. we might after the ſame manner as the Antipedobaptiſts except againſt as large expreſſions for Baptiſm, as all the people, all Nations, and ſay, That all the Congregation might mean only of all the males that were all then to meet; for that phraſe is uſed when then there is little colour for including the women, as in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.2, 3.

And yet ſee the practiſe, in <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. even as their baptizing men, and all theirs, houſholders, and their houſholds together, ſeems to be a plain imitation of the circumciſing men, and all their males at the firſt inſtitution of Circumciſion and the after-proſelyting of <hi>Heathens</hi> to them.

Only whereas they had an Ordinance acted upon males only, (yet ſo as the females were counted of the Circumciſion in and with them, as if they had been circumciſed too) the Commiſſion is in ſuch expreſſions as take in both Sexes, and the practiſe of baptizing both Sexes is expreſſed in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12. <hi>They were baptized both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> Which words are ſometimes uſed to denote both Sexes of any Age, rather then grown Ages only of either Sex, as may be ſeen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3.11.12. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.9.11. and 31.2, 3.

               </label> nor can their grounds be one and the ſame, that that ſhould be any warrant for this; for neither doth Baptiſm pertain to the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Circumciſion, nor ſucceeds it in its place &amp; room, &amp;c.</p>

               </label> There is much Analogy between Baptiſm, and Circumciſion, at leaſt as much as between the Prieſts under the Law, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, or as between the Altar-worſhip, and the Supper of the Lord. And ſo as much ground of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one to the other here as there, though I confeſs there is alſo great diſagreement betwixt them. I ſhall conſider both of them, and firſt the latter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They differ in the outward rite or matter of obſervance. Circumciſion was a cutting of the foreskin of the fleſh, Baptiſm is a waſhing of the fleſh. That had blood in it, becauſe true blood was not then ſhed that ſhould make attonement and expiation for our ſin, to which that therefore pointed: This hath no blood ſhed in it, becauſe the true blood that is propitiatory is ſhed, and no other propitiatory Sacrifice is remaining, only waſhing and cleanſing in the vertue of that that is ſhed, is now needful. And therefore ſuch an Ordinance only is left to us for our coming into the Church of Chriſt, as repreſents that to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They differ in the ſubject of them: That was only upon males, they being only capable of it, and yet ſo as that females were by way of interpretation included in them, as we noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; elſe all the females muſt have been excluded the Paſſover, contrary to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctours. But the Ordinance of Baptiſm is upon male and female both: yea the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctours ſay, it was ever ſo amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they proſelyted any to them, all their males were circumciſed, baptized, and brought an Offering, and all the females were baptized, and brought an Offering.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In limitation of time, Circumciſion was required on the eighth day, though in ſome caſes they might omit it then. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is not ſo ſtrictly tyed to a day, or ſet time. The reaſon we hinted before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Circumciſion bound over to the obſervation of the Law given, and to be given to the Fathers, and by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and ſo to all the whole obſervation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion: but Baptiſm bindeth not thereto, but <hi>to the faith and yoke of Chriſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all things commanded by him, Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Circumciſion was to bring them under the profeſſion of an expectation <hi>of the promiſed Seed yet to come, and not as then come:</hi> but Baptiſm is <hi>to bring men under the profeſſion of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:112427:43"/> promiſed Seed, as actually come, and now to us Gentiles, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving accompliſhed in himſelf the ſin-offering, and work of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for our ſalvation, and ſo into the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and of God as known in him, Father, Son, and Spirit, Acts</hi> 2.37, 38. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. In theſe things they differ, but in the main end they agree.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They agree in this, in being both the way or <hi>mediums</hi> of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyting or bringing into an acknowledged unity with the Church in outward profeſſion, and obligation, to obſerve the worſhip of God therein according to the reſpective Adminiſtrations of it, now, and then: for as Circumciſion was the Ordinance by which perſons were admitted and declared to be of the Church of God, and Religion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Branches of the ſtock of <hi>Abraham:</hi> So Baptiſm is that Ordinance by which perſons are admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and declared to be of the Church of Chriſt in its external Form, and Government, and become from the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ingraffed viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Branches of the ſtock of <hi>Abraham</hi> too, as ſhall after more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: They that ſhould not have been reckoned Branches of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> but by Circumciſion, are now ſo reckoned by Baptiſm. And as that (Circumciſion) bound to the obſervation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion then of God inſtituted to inſtruct men to Chriſt, ſo this (Baptiſm) obliges to the Religion, and worſhip of God, inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us about Chriſt, as now inſtituted by Chriſt. So that children of Chriſtians being to be brought up in the Chriſtian inſtitution, nurture, and inſtruction, it follows that they are to be brought up in it, and obliged to it by Baptiſm; all the children of the <hi>Jews</hi> and Proſelytes were in their way by Circumciſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They agree in this: That as Circumciſion was but an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinance inſtructing to an internal Circumciſion of the heart, and ſealing the righteouſneſs of the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> that he had in his uncircumciſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That he did righteouſly in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in God according to his word concerning the promiſed Seed, and his bleſſing of him, and that God would perform his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes righteouſly to him, and all that walk in that righteous faith of his: So Baptiſm is but an external Ordinance too, inſtructing to the inward waſhing and purifying of the heart by the grace of God in Chriſt to the meet making of a man to participate of the Covenant, and promiſed Inheritance; and it witneſſes to the ſame promiſes partly as performed in the coming, death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:112427:44"/> of Chriſt, and partly as nigh at hand, and ready to be performed to men in believing on Chriſt, that promiſed Seed, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did: as that all that ſo do ſhall be bleſſed with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhall have remiſſion of ſins, righteouſneſs, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and eternal life. And thus its ſaid, <hi>That John witneſſed unto Chriſt the true light:</hi> which is to be underſtood of <hi>John,</hi> not as a man ſimply, but as preaching and baptizing: ſo that his Baptiſm pointed to Chriſt to believe on him with the promiſes of forgiveneſs of ſins, and the gift of the Holy Ghoſt to them that ſhould ſo do. As Circumciſion ſealed not the preſent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the party circumciſed, as if all that received that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance were partakers with <hi>Abraham</hi> in the righteouſneſs reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, but to the righteouſneſs of his faith: ſo neither doth Baptiſm witneſs the righteouſneſs of the party baptized; for ſuch may be a generation of vipers; chaff, and not wheat, in the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity, but to the faith of Chriſt, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine publiſhed concerning him, as that <hi>He is the Lamb of God that takes away the ſin of the world, and that whoſoever belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him ſhall be reckoned righteous, and have eternal life.</hi> So that the uſe of Baptiſm in its teſtimony and witneſs doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more obſtruct the baptizing Infants, then that atteſted to, and ſealed in Circumciſion, obſtructed formerly their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is the ſame diſtinction of Baptiſm, as of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into outward and inward, and the ſame emptineſs in the one, as in the other, where meerly outward. There was a Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fleſh, and a Circumciſion of the heart, and the former without the latter, was no Circumciſion in the ſight of God for admitting perſons to the enjoyment of the righteouſneſs of God: So there is a Baptiſm in water unto repentance, inſtructing to that inward waſhing of the heart, but that alone ſaveth not, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a true ſpiritual Chriſtian more then the other external Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance made a true ſpiritual <hi>Iſraelite:</hi> This is but the putting away the filthineſs of the fleſh, but its the waſhing, and ſo the anſwer of a good conſcience through the Reſurrection of Chriſt, that giveth right to fellowſhip with God in ſpiritual grace and glory, and <hi>which ſeals up the ſoul to the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Matth.</hi> 3.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20, 21. So that nothing more is in the nature of this Baptiſm, then was in Circumciſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar Infants from it.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:112427:44"/>4. There was no more compulſion to be uſed in proſelyting by Circumciſion, then in diſcipling by Baptiſm. The <hi>Gentile</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes were to declare themſelves as willing to renounce their falſe worſhips, and accept of the Jewiſh Religion with its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, as ever we read that any Chriſtian Proſelytes, or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples did, and yet their Infants were proſelyted notwithſtanding any want of ſuch perſonal profeſſion. Thus (as <hi>Ainſworth</hi> out of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbins informs us in his Annotations on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12.) was their practiſe. <q>If they received of the <hi>Heathen</hi> a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant grown, and he was not willing to be circumciſed, his Maſter dealeth with him a whole twelve-month more then that it was not lawful to keep him; and if in that time he was not willing, he ſold him to the <hi>Heathen.</hi> And ſo for a woman ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captive that any had a mind to make his wife, they forced them not to be <hi>Iews,</hi> but dealt with her a whole year to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their religion, and if ſhe accepted not, they might ſell her.</q> This for thoſe under their own power, and diſpoſe, whether bought, or taken captive; but for ſuch as came to be proſelyted, <q>they uſed to inquire diligently, leſt they came for by-reſpects,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ainſw.</hi> on Deut. 21.12.</note> as riches, or for dignity, or for fear; and if they find no ſuch thing, then they make known to him the Laws weightineſs, and the toil in doing of it above what other people have, to ſee if they will leave off. If they take it upon them, and withdraw not (unto which there muſt be ſome publick profeſſion; for it was never done but in the preſence of three) then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him.</q> So that that confeſſion of ſins, or profeſſion of faith, in thoſe that came to Baptiſm in grown years, was no unuſual thing or unlike to the practiſe of Proſelytes in being circumciſed to their Religion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When they came to be circumciſed; in coming to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their families to the Church of God, they came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wing of his protection; ſo when men and their families come unto the Church of Chriſt, and are by Baptiſm obliged to his yoke and doctrine, they come to under his protection and ſalvation. Whence theſe phraſes of ſalvation coming to ſuch a houſe as where Chriſt and the Goſpel was received, and they were thereupon baptized, as <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. <hi>Believe in the Lord Ieſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy houſe.</hi> So in that of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, Luke</hi> 19.9, 19. of which protection nothing but the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:112427:45"/> willing refuſals of ſome party in the houſe could deprive them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Circumciſion was but once acted upon perſons, and that was in their admiſſion into the Church of God, (<hi>except in that caſe of the children in the wilderneſs, Joſh.</hi> 5.4.7.) So neither find we any warrant for iterating Baptiſm, that hath been made into the Name of the Lord Jeſus. Indeed there is a place in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.4, 5. that ſeems to ſay that ſome Diſciples fore-baptized were baptized again. But the anſwer to that is known, that theſe words, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>[When they heard this, they were baptized into the Name of the Lord Ieſus]</hi> relates not to thoſe Diſciples, but to the people baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> which I confeſs doth not ſatisfie me. I think the Text may afford another, and bettet anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were baptized again, becauſe as themſelves confeſs they were baptized into Baptiſm: For when they were asked into what they were baptized, they ſay not into the <hi>Meſſias</hi> held forth by <hi>Iohn, but into Iohns Baptiſm.</hi> Its probable that ſome that thought it neceſſary for them to be baptized, and yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not into what Name or Doctrine, but minded more <hi>Iohns</hi> act of baptizing or waſhing them, then the Name or Doctrine declared by him, had come and preſſed a neceſſity of baptizing them, as <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized the people, but held not forth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning Chriſt which he baptized them into, and ſo they were baptized into his Baptiſm, and not unto the Name and Doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus. And I am the rather induced to believe that this is true, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> relates unto them the Doctrine that <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized into, as a thing which they had not minded, and as that which they could never have been baptized and diſcipled to, but that they muſt in knowing or hearing of, that have heard of the Holy Ghoſt. And beſides its ſaid, that <hi>When they heard that,</hi> (as if they had never heard it before) <hi>then they were baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Name of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> And truly it ſeems to me to be thus with many Rebaptizers, they baptize into Baptiſm. For the Name of Chriſt men had been baptized into before, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed more or leſs into the faith of him, even the generality of thoſe they urge Baptiſm unto, and baptize again; yea there is often nothing concerning this Name of Chriſt, in which they that are thus baptized by them differ from others; nor from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, while content with their Infant-Baptiſm, only they have
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:112427:45"/> been by them baptized upon profeſſion of joyning with them in their way and Doctrine and Baptiſm. Whence its clear that they are baptized into Baptiſm, or into fellowſhip with ſuch a man, and his way of Baptiſm then into the Name of Chriſt. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as formerly Baptiſm into Chriſt was the note of diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe that acknowledged Chriſt the Son of God, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world, and looked for ſalvation by him; and them that believed not ſo, but worſhipped either <hi>Heathen</hi> Idols, or God in another name, and not in Chriſt: now they make it a diſtinction from the generality of them that profeſs that Name, though in point of faith nothing differing from them, ſo that its the Name of Baptiſm that they run out withal, and baptiſe into, crying, <hi>Oh this is Baptiſm, an excellent and needful Baptiſm.</hi> Its not the Name of Chriſt that they make the proper Character of their Church, and which they are diſtinguiſhed from others by, for that they had as much before perhaps, and others have as ſubſtantially that profeſs and own not another baptizing. Such ſeem to me to need rather to returne back again from that their Baptiſm, then to preſs others to be baptized therein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as if it was the neceſſary thing in which men are to have ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And indeed herein alſo Baptiſm and Circumciſion agree, That as that was the Note of diſtinction (Circumciſion I mean, as witneſſing the righteouſneſs of the faith, and obliging to the Law) between the Church of God, and all other people, ſo as that all that were circumciſed by vertue of that appointment of God, were reputed the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God according to profeſſion; though of different Tribes, Nations, and ways of worſhip, (as after happened between the ten Tribes, and the two, and ſo the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>) ſo as that though upon their erring from the Law, and right form of worſhip, they were no therein to be joyned withall, yet upon ſight of their errour, and idolatry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing it, they might be received into unity of worſhip with them that rightly worſhipped, without a new urging or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their former Circumciſion, although done in thoſe times that they or their Fathers worſhipped not aright according to the Law which it obliged: So Baptiſm diſtinguiſhes, and was at firſt the badge of diſtinction between the Church profeſſing the faith of Chriſt, and worſhip of God according to him, and all
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:112427:46"/> others, whether <hi>Iews,</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> not ſubmitting to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Name, and Inſtitution; and ſuch as retain that Name and profeſſion, and are baptized thereinto, though in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar beliefs and wayes of worſhipping in that Name, they have exceedingly erred and corrupted themſelves from God, yet need nothing for their having fellowſhip with thoſe that worſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in that Name but the renouncing and letting go their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partures from Chriſt in their idolatrous and evil principles, and practiſes; without any altering or iterating their former Baptiſm. So that the Analogy between theſe two, is ſuch as affords ground enough for arguing; as the Apoſtle did in caſes before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it being a clear caſe that children are to be ſubjected to Chriſt, and brought up in his nurture and admonition: So that the leſs need of an expreſs Command in a caſe ſo like to what was practiſed conſtantly before; and which ſucceeded that of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion too eſpecially, as to us <hi>Gentiles.</hi> They being now to be taken by Baptiſm into <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, or Church, propoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the holding forth of his faith, who formerly were to have been not ſo taken in, and joyned to them but by Circumciſion: Nor mattered it againſt this that they were for a time together in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, for ſo was <hi>Solomon</hi> anointed during <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> life and raign, and yet his Succeſſour, and ſo the Apoſtles who ſucceeded Chriſt in point of Miniſtration to the Church, did yet miniſter ſomtime before his Aſcenſion. Nay, there being no prohibition of this practiſe of taking in children in expreſs or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed terms, its as a ſilent confirming of that order in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing way of admiſſion. Yea, his telling us that the Kingdom is of ſuch as thoſe little ones brought to him, and expreſs bidding his Diſciples diſciple all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> baptizing them, amounts to little leſs then a poſitive expreſs Order for baptizing them.</p>
            <p>Now whereas its objected further, that Baptiſm and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion pertain to divers Covenants: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> The former to a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his carnal ſeed; This is to Chriſt, and his ſpiritual ſeed. That was a Covenant of carnal promiſes, and earthly enjoyments: This a Covenant of ſpiritual promiſes and heavenly enjoyments: therefore none ſhould be admitted into the Chriſtian Church but ſpiritual ſtones, real believers. As Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was upon carnal Infants, or natural children: ſo ſhould Baptiſm be upon ſpiritual Infants, new-born babes in Chriſt. I
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:112427:46"/> ſhall conſider nextly (by Gods aſſiſtance) what ſubſtance is in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Covenant that God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> whereto Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was annexed as the ſigne of it, was a ſpiritual Covenant containing moſt heavenly and ſpiritual promiſes; As, <hi>that in him, and his ſeed ſhould all the Nations be bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 12.3. which the Apoſtle calls the Goſpel preached to him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>That God would be his God, and the God of his ſeed, and that he ſhould be the Father of many Nations.</hi> The former of which is the moſt ſpiritual promiſe ſet before the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>to be their God.</hi> A promiſe reaching beyond this life, even to the ſtate of Glory. Whence Chriſt proves by this very priviledge of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob, That the dead ſhall riſe, even thoſe dead perſons, Matth.</hi> 22.31, 32. And the Apoſtle tells us that upon it is grounded, or therein is contained Gods providing them the Inheritance it ſelf, even that City or ſtate of Glory with his ſeed, that as yet he hath not received, or had not in his life time; <hi>Far they died in faith, not having received the promiſes, Heb.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15, 16. Yea, what greater glory or priviledge is ſet before us Chriſtians, or ſhall be inherited by us in the <hi>New-Jeruſalem</hi> then this? <hi>He that overcometh, ſhall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my Son, Revel.</hi> 21.7. <hi>And they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them their God, ver.</hi> 4. And for the making him a Father of many Nations, this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, <hi>takes in the ſpiritual Seed, even all the believers through the Goſpel, or word of promiſe revealed to him, and now more fully to us in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Yea at length the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>when they ſhall all remember, and turn to God, Pſal.</hi> 22.27. And ſure his giving him Chriſt to be his Seed, that all Nations ſhould be bleſſed in, and by vertue of union with him multitudes out of all Nations, and in due ſeaſon the generality of all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be his Seed, was no carnal, but a moſt ſpiritual bleſſing; and ſo the Apoſtle ſets it before the <hi>Gentiles, as a moſt ſpiritual bleſſing, to be the Seed of Abraham according to promiſe, and to have him the Father of us all, Gallat.</hi> 3.29, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>But we find that God promiſed to make him exceeding fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and to give him the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">

               </label> and this latter called the Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>And are not theſe things car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?</hi>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> We may underſtand them carnally, and ſpiritually both, and both ways true: God made him exceeding fruitful, as a ſpiritual Father, or as by the Word of promiſe given unto him, and held forth by him, and in his poſterities many were born to the faith of him, and by union with Chriſt (who according to the fleſh deſcended from his loins, and was held forth in his faith or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) came to be his children, who alſo are made truly Kings unto God. And the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was not only nor ſo much the Land in its then eſtate; for ſo neither he, nor <hi>Iſaac,</hi> nor <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> (nor many of his ſeed) had it in their life times: <hi>For he gave him none inheritance in it, no not to ſet his foot upon, Acts</hi> 7.5. They lived not to enjoy it for their portion, and though his ſeed after the fleſh had it, and dwelt in it, yet that was <hi>but a little while, Iſai.</hi> 63.18. whereas in the Covenant it is given <hi>for an everlaſting poſſeſſion:</hi> Therefore ſure the Glory of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in it is the thing mainly promiſed, and ſo in the reſtauration of all things they ſhall poſſeſs it, even the ſpiritual Seed, when made new, and in a new and glorious way, in the <hi>New-Jeruſalem, when become the joy of the whole Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Though theſe promiſes were fulfilled carnally, out of his loins naturally Kings and Princes came, and many of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed had, and dwelt in the Land, yet that would not make the Covenant to be carnal: for if promiſes of carnal mercies in a Covenant make it carnal, then the Covenant in Chriſt now is carnal too, for therein alſo is the promiſe of this life, as well as of that that is to come, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. Thence the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.3. applyes that carnal promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> with a little alteration to children of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> now: <hi>That thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt live long in the earth:</hi> anſwers to that, <hi>That thou mayeſt live long in the Land that the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> Thoſe temporal promiſes then cannot make it to have been a carnal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, no more then the adding of promiſes for the things of this life makes the Covenant in Chriſt a carnal Covenant. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Mediation and Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a Miniſter of the Old Teſtament given by him, was exerciſed more immediately about thoſe carnal promiſes, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.1.14. As Types of the more heavenly things, (even as his Law was an injunction of typical carnal Services, and ceremonial Obſervations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 98, 10.)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:112427:47"/> To which the Miniſtration of Chriſt, and Mediation of better promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5, 6. is oppoſed (as is evident throughout the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi>) and not to the Covenant and Promiſes made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> to which Circumciſion was firſt annexed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though Circumciſion obliged to the Obſervation of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Law, when it was given, yet (as the Apoſtle tells us) it was a ſeal not ſo much of the carnal promiſes, as of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Abraham's</hi> faith: <hi>viz. That God would reckon them the Seed of Abraham, and impute righteouſneſs to them, as to Abraham, in ſo believing, Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12.23. So that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as circumciſion was annexed to it as a Seal was rather as it was a Covenant of ſpiritual promiſes: even as to ſuch promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Baptiſm eſpecially witneſſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> intereſted in, and heirs of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, are, and were always not a carnal as ſuch, but a ſpiritual Seed: Though a multiplication of his carnal ſeed alſo was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the Covenant, as to his own particular, yet the proper heirs of the Covenant in the righteouſneſs of the faith that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion ſealed, were only a ſpiritual Seed, the Sons of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. The Apoſtle is clear for this, when he makes Chriſt the Seed, to whom the Covenant or Promiſes were made, and that is Chriſt perſonally and myſtically. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16.29. <hi>If ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abrahams ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.12.16. <hi>Abraham is Father not only of them that believe being circumciſed, but of thoſe that are Gentile-believers of the uncircumciſion alſo: They that are of the ſteps of the faith of Abraham, whether circumciſed, or uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, they are the Seed, and the promiſe is ſure to all them.</hi> And what more plainly then that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6.8. <hi>That not all that are of Iſrael, therefore are Iſrael; nor becauſe they are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams ſeed are they therefore children; but the children of the promiſe, they are counted for the ſeed:</hi> that is, <hi>They that are born of the promiſe, or grace of God held forth in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or Goſpel of Chriſt: For in his death and reſurrection, the promiſe is ſaid to be performed to us that was made to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Acts</hi> 13.32, 33. There is no branch in the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſealed and confirmed to all the natural ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as their proper legacy and portion that God would not fail to give them abſolutely, no not in the things that were but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:112427:48"/> external: the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was not the portion of them all, nor enjoyed by them, nor fruitfulneſs in iſſue, &amp;c. Its true, all the outward mercies that the natural ſeed enjoyed; yea, their very beings of his off-ſpring, were parts of the faithfulneſs of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and they themſelves were in a part the fulfilling of the Covenant to him. But thoſe things that <hi>Abraham</hi> hath heirs in after the Covenant, (heirs of the Covenant promiſes) were not to the Seed after the fleſh, but after the Spirit, Chriſt, and his members.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> is the ſame that the believers of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are under, and its performed in them, and to them. In them as his ſeed in Chriſt, to them as God is their God, and they his people, and ſhall have the <hi>New-Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Canaan</hi> with him; as they are bleſſed with him in remiſſion of ſins, and righteouſneſs. And this flows from the former, <hi>For if they be his ſeed, and heirs, then inheritors of his bleſſings, Gal.</hi> 3.14. And if not ſo, then not his ſeed, and heirs, if what they enjoy, or are intereſted in, are other riches then thoſe given to him. Indeed this is peculiar to him, <hi>That he is Father of us all that believe, even of many Nations; and ſo that Chriſt in whom the ſeed is choſen, and begotten, is his Son according to the fleſh, and was to come of his ſeed after the fleſh.</hi> Though in this latter the peculiarity is not his from all others, for many of his ſeed alſo had it with him, but from multitudes of his ſeed, and others that had not ſo. But the Scripture is expreſs, <hi>That the uncircumciſed Gentile-believers have intereſt in the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in other things, in that it calls them,</hi>

There the heirs were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the fleſh were to be trained up in that way of bondage under types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows pointing to Chriſt, but now under the Goſpel-declaration in a plainer way, and more ſpiritual, with ſuch Ordinances, as are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:112427:48"/> annexed and fitted thereto; that Law of Ceremonies being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, &amp; ſo put to its period in the coming &amp; death of Chriſt. Thence there is a difference both of Goſpel-preaching, &amp; Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces now from what was then, they having ſuch as might nurture them to the expectation of the promiſed Seed, the Son of God in his coming in the fleſh; we ſuch as witneſs to him as already come dead, riſen, and glorified, and inſtruct to expect him coming in power, and ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Medium</hi> for begetting and bringing in ſons to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> according to the Spirit, was, and is one and the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, though otherwiſe now, then then in its declaration. They were always born of the Goſpel, and not of the Law, though nurtured under the Law, both before and after. And the Goſpel was the ſame as preached to them, and unto us, the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: <hi>viz. That in Abraham and his ſeed all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed; not in the works of the Law, but in him believed in.</hi> To the which faith the Law ſhut them up, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away all poſſibility of life, and bleſſing in and from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, while it diſcovered their ſins, and ſhewed them their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation under the curſe for its tranſgreſſions. Indeed then that Seed was preached as to come, now as already come, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſaving us: But always of that Goſpel, or Word of Gods free-grace, were the true Seed begotten: they were in all times the believers, and not the workers for life, and truſters in their works: And the word of faith was always Jeſus Chriſt, or the Seed that is Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who was yeſterday, to day, and the ſame for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things being conſidered, that difference before objected appears falſe, and to ſpring from wrong apprehenſions. Thence the inference there-from follows not, <hi>viz.</hi> That Baptiſm muſt be upon a ſpiritual Seed, as Circumciſion was upon a carnal; both of them in their ſeveral ſeaſons have been upon a ſpiritual, and upon a carnal too. Circumciſion was upon a carnal ſeed in <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and all the natural <hi>Iſraelites</hi> upon a ſpiritual, when a ſtranger joyned himſelf to the Lord in love to his Name, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56.3.6. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.41, 42. And ſo Baptiſm was upon the natural, carnal ſeed, and not ſpiritual, when the multitudes, even the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the people were baptized by <hi>John,</hi> chaff, as well as wheat; And upon the ſpiritual, and not carnal ſeed in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,

               <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and others of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> That inference ſprings from this wrong conception, that the one and the other, are ſeals of the Covenant, as due to the parties ſigned with them: which we have ſhewed before to be an errour: Circumciſion ſealed but the righteouſneſs of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith held forth to them, not the righteouſneſs of each perſon circumciſed, and his enjoyment of the Covenant, otherwiſe then upon condition of his ſo believing as <hi>Abraham</hi> did: neither doth Baptiſm witneſs the faith of the party baptized, or that he is an heir of promiſe, but to Chriſt, and the faithfulneſs of God in performing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in Chriſt: that we are ſinners in our ſelves, and need clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, otherwiſe not fit for fellowſhip with God; but that there is in Chriſt a cleanſing and propitiation made ready for us, that he takes away the ſin of the world; and that whoſo believeth in him, turning from all other things to God, by him ſhall meet with righteouſneſs, and forgiveneſs: they are both of them Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the outward Court, or of admiſſion into the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Regiment of Chriſts Kingdom, in which men are to wait upon him for inſtructions and teachings to ſalvation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſaith men ſhould believe in him, and having believed, that they ſhould yet go on to do ſo, and they ſhall meet with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> unto them. <hi>The Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt, is indeed upon the ſpiritual Seed only,</hi> (if we grant them in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. to have been ſpiritually born) <hi>ſealing them up to the day of Redemption:</hi> but the outward Baptiſm is not ſo limited, it being a more carnal thing acted upon the fleſh. Nor ſay I that perſons (Infants, or others) are to be baptized upon this ground, that they are in the Covenant, and heirs of it in a proper ſenſe: but becauſe Chriſt being Lord and Saviour hath ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and forgiveneſs in him for them all, and they are to ſubmit unto him, and be trained up for him, that in minding and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt his ſayings faithfully they may become heirs, and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his Covenant, and Kingdom; as to that purpoſe we find <hi>John</hi> inſtructing the people that came unto his Baptiſm, <hi>That they might be made meet to inherit with the Saints, or to receive the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, and be gathered into the Garner, Luke</hi> 3.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9, 10, 11, 12. And we find him <hi>baptizing Publicans, Souldiers, Phariſees, Sadduces:</hi> yea, the generality of the people, concerning whom he never ſaith,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:112427:49"/> That they were therefore the Heirs of the promiſe, or Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according thereunto, but exhorts them not to reckon themſelves ſo, becauſe of their birth of him, nor think becauſe of their preſent Baptiſm, that they were ſure enough, telling them, <hi>his Baptiſm was but with water unto repentance,</hi> or to inſtruct them that they ſhould repent; that he admitted one and other, chaff, and wheat; that Chriſt to whom he witneſſed, and inſtructed them to look, had the true Baptiſm, that would indeed cleanſe and renew them, the Baptiſm of the Spirit, &amp;c. The like we may obſerve of the Apoſtles baptizing the <hi>Gentiles, That it was a bringing them into the houſe of God, where the Feaſt is to be had, into the ſociety of thoſe that acknowledge him come in the fleſh, and to be the Son of God, there to attend the Kings coming to them, and taking them into his banqueting Chambers, Matth.</hi> 22.9, 10. And he puts the difference between thoſe that are made meet for the Feaſt by and in his Servants Miniſtration, and them that are not, and accordingly deals with them. Indeed its too low a conceit to think that an external Ordinance ſhould ſeal an internal, ſpiritual heirſhip. That's the work of Chriſt, or Chriſt by the Spirit of promiſe. When men in the Goſpel hearing have believed, and in attendance to ſuch outward nurture as the external form of the Kingdom affords, are brought into, and made ſingle for Chriſt; then he ſeals them with his Spirit of promiſe, and owns them for heirs, as the Scripture witneſſeth, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.6.5. Heirſhip follows his juſtifying by his grace, which is met with, and received by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.9. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. and then after that follows the Spirits ſealing, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16. Indeed there is a double juſtifying, waſhing, and cleanſing. One, Miniſterial by men, as when a <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> turning in to the Doctrine of the Goſpel to own it, is waſhed by Baptiſm, and therein miniſterially acquitted, and cleared from all his former idolatry, ſo that the Church charges it not upon him, as to their carriage towards him. The other is Gods act, when a ſoul in, and through the Goſpel, throughly and cordially believing is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted and owned of God: Upon this ſecond follows his ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Its true, the <hi>Jews</hi> with all their Proſelytes, were called <gap reason="foreign">

Children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant that God made with Abraham:</hi> Which ſignifies not only that they were the natural Seed of the Prophets, and of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (for perhaps that they might not all be, there might be many of them who had grown in with them out of other ſtocks, by becoming Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes) but all that were circumciſed (as they were) were to have the Covenant firſt tendred to them, and indeed conditionally made with them; and they were under that part of it that afforded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and means to them to become of the ſpiritual Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> The Doctrine of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the ſalvation in him, (further explicated by the Prophets in their ſucceding generations) and that added Doctrine for Precepts and Ceremonies for inſtructing unto him, and for ſhutting them up in ſin from all confidence in themſelves, that they might be forced to accept of him; this they were under, and children of, and born, and brought up in a way of nurture to ſeek after, and look for its moſt glorious promiſes, which in obeying the voice of God ſo as to have their hearts circumciſed thereby, to walk in the ſteps of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they ſhould alſo have had made good unto them; as is clear to me in <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.4, 6. where the Prophet calling upon the people to hear the words of the Covenant, and pronouncing a curſe to every one that obeyeth them not, tells them its the ſame he commanded them, when he brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Obey my voice, and ſo ſhall ye be my people, and I will be your God, that I may perform to you the Oath that I ſware to your Fathers to give them, a Land flowing with milk and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi> What more clear then that the Covenant of Gods being a God unto them, and taking them for a people, and the things abſolutely promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſpiritual Seed, were conditionally made and propounded to them that were the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſeed and family of <hi>Abraham;</hi> yea, and ſo he was alſo with them to protect and keep them, yea, to circumciſe their hearts, and draw them nearer to him, while they were with him: but in forſaking him, and hardening their hearts againſt him, he alſo withdrew from them from doing them good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.9, 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.6, 7, 8. So that in this ſence they were <hi>foederati,</hi> in the Covenant, it was held forth to them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of walking in the ſteps of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:112427:50"/> obedience of faith, and they were taken in under the wing of the Almighty for the nurture of his Law and Doctrine with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thereunto. In which they were priviledged above all other peoples, and diſtinguiſhed from them, they being an holy people to God, and all others unclean to them unleſs proſelyted to them; and yet the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom the promiſes were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly made, were as we have ſeen only the ſeed according to grace that walk in the ſteps of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to them only God ingaged himſelf to give the righteouſneſs of his faith that was ſealed in the ſigne of Circumciſion; and not to any of them that miſtaking the mind of God, thought themſelves <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſeed, becauſe born of his fleſh, and therein reſted; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe obſervers of the Law commanded for their inſtruction and convincement, and there reſted, or ſought righteouſneſs therein, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7.31, 32. But now the promiſed Seed being come, who is the heir of bleſſing, and that brings it down to us, and he having done and accompliſhed all thoſe things in himſelf, that thoſe foregoing ſhadows of the Law pointed to concerning him, they were now to have ceaſed looking to him, and in ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of have come to him, and his inſtitution, even all of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. as may appear clearly in this, <hi>That thoſe that rejected him, were old and young, infants and ſucklings,</hi> included in the puniſhment denounced upon rejecters of him, <hi>viz.</hi> deſolation and unchurching, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.14, 15. and 11.21, 22 23, 24. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.44. And by this that when they ſhall come in, the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall come in together, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.8. but now moſt of them refuſed him, and his Kingdom. Whereupon (the partition wall of the legal ceremonial Ordinances being broken down in Chriſts death) it pleaſed God rejecting them again, to ſet forth his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto all people, and to ſend his ſervants with as full and large a Commiſſion for bringing in all Nations into his houſe, as before they had to invite the <hi>Jews</hi> that were forbidden, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.8, 9. that ſo he might perform his Covenant and promiſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in making him a Father of many Nations.

Which Subjects with their priviledges were of a double rank: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that are born of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> begotten un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, believers in him as he was; and to them by vertue of the Covenant appertained the ſpecial preſence and bleſſing of God in juſtifying, ſanctifying, owning peculiarly and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as his people, and making out himſelf to them as their God to eternal life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such as were brought under the tenders of the Covenant, with whom God was dealing, and whom he was inſtructing to hear and liſten to him, and ſo conditionally holding forth the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to them, but not overcome as yet, to be of his ſpiritual Seed, to believe and walk in faith as <hi>Abraham</hi> did. Yet to them he granted the liberty of his Ordinances, and the Inſtructions held forth therein, and therewith, and ſuch a diſpenſation of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and operation of his Spirit with them, as in yeilding to which, and following on after him therein, they might be brought
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:112427:51"/> to the true Circumciſion of heart in the ſpiritual knowledge of God, and ſo to be of that ſpiritual Seed, with much patience and goodneſs towards them, with protection and defence of them againſt thoſe who for their profeſſion ſake would harm them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 81.9, 10, 11, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.17, 18. and 5.3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>The latter of theſe (many of them) not being by the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit vouchſafed, brought to believe, and to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in heart, but contenting themſelves with an outward profeſſion after many rebellions of themſelves and Fore-fathers, were broken off from thoſe ordinantial priviledges and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and protection of God therewith afforded them, and ſo from the way and means of participating of that juice and ſweetneſs peculiar to the ſpiritual Seed, much more from the enjoyment of thoſe things themſelves. As many of them in their particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had been before-time more ſecretly and indiſcernably for their miſcarryings in the receipt of, and ſubjection to the Doctrine held forth from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in his houſe broken off from li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the former, who yet poſſibly might continue in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal profeſſion and ſociety of the Church owned by God unto their deaths: ſo now after many deſires to gather them, and after their many reſiſtings of the Holy Ghoſt, the generality of them, or the greateſt part of their preſent ſpringing branches with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of their dependant twigs; that is, their poſterity, were broken off and unbodyed from the latter alſo, his ſervants with their meſſage being ſent from them, (to whom God uſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to ſend his Prophets) to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and not only the promiſes held forth to them, but the Church-form-ſtate and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges delivered to them. And this is to be minded, that the thing moſt evidently ſpoken to in this buſineſs of breaking off, and graffing in, is that Church-ſtate which is more viſible, and outward, with that preſence and operation of Spirit that is ſuited thereto; and not as ſome ſay, The inviſible ſtate of the higheſt favour by election, for that thoſe broken off never had, nor could thoſe graffed in been in poſſibility to have loſt, as is intimated in that expreſſion, <hi>If thou that art grafted in, doſt not continue in his goodneſs, thou ſhalt alſo be broken off.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Its true, that no <hi>Gentile,</hi> or his children, hath ſo immediate right by nature to branchſhip in this root, as <hi>Abraham's</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed had. No <hi>Gentile</hi> is of this tree or ſtock but by inſition, nor ever was in the times before Chriſt; which inſition is not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to election, and an inward gracious implanting there-from, ſpringing as the Objection ſayes; for as to the branchſhip in Church-ſtate, the <hi>Jews</hi> rather had that by election then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people, they being in that reſpect called an <hi>Elect people, Deut.</hi> 7.6, 7, 8. and 10.15. And as for the eternal Covenant-ſtate none are more or leſs naturally in that then other, it being meerly by grace, in which there is no room for fear, leſt they be broken off, if the Doctrine of Election be not mainly miſtaken. Its plain that that which the one were broken off from, the other were graffed in into, and that from that there is ſuppoſed a poſſibility of ſome of thoſe graffed ones to be broken again; and its plain that unto that branchſhip in ſtanding in actual and viſible fellowſhip with <hi>Abraham</hi> in the inſtitution and profeſſion of the faith delivered to him, as to its ſubſtance, and ſo to the external Church-ſtate and priviledges, ſome came according to nature as born of him, and brought up from their beginning therein, (as out of the true Olive ſpring naturally many branches that never were brought from other, whereunto it, though even of thoſe branches all may not prove fruitful, and ſo many be lopt and cut off,) and others by natural growth or birth ſpring not out of that root and ſtock, but are taken out of other wild Olives, and are implanted into this fellowſhip, and thereby have union with, and partake of the ſap of the root. Now thoſe twigs which naturally ſhoot up from
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:112427:52"/> theſe latter are alſo in the ſame root with them from which they ſpring by vertue of their inſition into it till ſome way broken off, though neither they nor their branches from which they ſpring are originally natural branches to the root, but branches by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which this root naturally and originally did not produce. And ſo in all ages the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ingraffed preter-naturally. When a man became a Proſelyte, he became of that ſtock by faith: by firſt believing the Doctrine either really or profeſſedly, and ſo by inſition or adoption into that ſociety or tree, and by vertue of that inſition all his children that ſprung up from him (while in that Stock or Church-fellowſhip at leaſt) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came branches of it too; but yet inaſmuch as they ſprung natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from an ingraffed branch, and not from the natural, they were originally ingraffed, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, They have it naturally to be branches of that ingraffed branch, and ſo they ſhould have been, had it ſtood in the wild Olive, and never been tranſlocated, but they have it not by nature to be branches of this tree, and ſuch, or ſo diſpoſed as now, that they have by vertue of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twigs or branches of an inſition: between which and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural branches, as to right of participation of the juice and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the root, there is now no more difference. Thus it was with the <hi>Gentile</hi> Proſelytes, in regard of the Common matter ſealed or admitted to by Circumciſion, and thus it is ſtill (by the Apoſtles arguing there) the <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts became branches of that ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not naturally, but by inſition, by which inſition their children come to branchſhip in that Olive too, and not by nature in reſpect of the root, and natural ſtock of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> to which that diſtinction of <gap reason="foreign">

So that that difference of phraſe makes no more for the denying believers Infants of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> a branchſhip in this tree, by vertue of their parents inſition, then it doth to the Infants of Proſelytes in former times; a branchſhip, I ſay, till by unbelief broken off, for then the caſe is altered again with them, as with the children of the <hi>Jews</hi> broken off for the ſame reaſon: Which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is alſo worth the minding: <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe of the natural branches which were broken off, were broken off <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, agree to them, unleſs we ſhall ſay, they are all damned, <hi>Mark</hi> 16 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.46.

Now if their natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were natural branches of the Olive, and had a ſtanding in the branchſtate, till rejecters actually, then they muſt have the ordinary badge of branches, that is, the external Baptiſm. Of which I have yet met with no colourable plea to deprive any branch, not yet by actual refuſing and unbelief, breaking off himſelf there-from, nor by others before off-broken: for I think all grant that, that whoſoever is of the Church viſibly as to his right to him Baptiſm may not be denyed by us. To which if we adde that the partition wall being broken down between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> eſpecially the believers of both, that which appertains by way of priviledge to the one, as to matter of Church-ſtate appertains equally to the other. We ſhall conclude that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are branches too by vertue of their parents naturalizing or inſition,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.19.</note> and ſo have the like right to Baptiſm. For that this branch-ſtate is the ſtate of viſible Churching unto God, and of right to the priviledges flowing there-from in union with the root thereof laid in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not as is imagined by ſome, the inward inviſible ſtate of union with Chriſt, and election, we have in part ſhewed before, and ſhall (becauſe that's the main thing that can colourably make againſt what is here ſaid) be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proved.</p>
            <p>For to what hath been ſaid, it may be added, That if the ſtate of branchſhip here ſpoken of, was a ſtate of eternal choice and election to eternal life, which the <hi>Gentile</hi> branches are affirmed to have here, then might they rejoyce againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> as in a leſs fearful caſe of ſtanding; the <hi>Jew</hi> ſtood ſo as to be broken off, but the <hi>Gentile</hi> is in no capacity to that, that is indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed in; whereas the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That their ſtanding in this branchſhip is by faith;</hi> ſo as if they reject that, God would break them off too: Nay he uſes it as an Argument of aw and fear, <hi>That they were branches beſide nature, and the Jews by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

And again he tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>That as pertaining to the election, they are beloved for their fathers ſakes, and are ſhut up under unbelief, that he might have mercy upon them all:</hi> But its for the Goſpel in regard of their not accepting that that they are now enemies to him, as if he ſhould directly tell us, that he ſpeaks not here of them according to election, but according to their carriage toward the Goſpel, and ſo they being now thrown off from the priviledges of thoſe that receive and own it, thoſe they are broken off from, which otherwiſe they ſhould have now had alſo. Such a ſtate of faith and election, as ſome Antipedobaptiſts put this branchſhip in could they not be broken off from. I know againſt this they have this ſilly conceit, that they are ſaid to be broken off that ſeemed to be branches in that ſtock, or to be ingraffed, though they were never branches indeed; but this is a <hi>contradiction in adjecto,</hi> to talk of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off that that was never in, Nay, to ſpeak of natural branches, as thoſe that were ſo according to nature, and yet to ſay, they were never at all branches; ſure ſuch an argument would have no terrour, nor ſhew of reaſon, they that ſeemed to be branches but never were ſo, were thrown by; then take heed leſt thou that ſtandeſt by faith, beeſt thrown by alſo. And that in <hi>ver.</hi> 20. of the ingraffed branches, ſhould rather be, <hi>Thou mayeſt happily have neither faith nor ſtanding at all, therefore be not high minded:</hi> Then thus, <hi>Thou ſtandeſt by faith, be not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, but fear.</hi> The like fond conceit they have upon <hi>John</hi> 15.4. <hi>Every branch in me that bringeth not forth fruit, ſhall be taken away, &amp;c.</hi> That is, ſay ſome, that pretends to be in me, but is not ſo at all: As if Chriſt ſpake according to the lying ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions or diſſimulations of men, and called them branches in him, which only belyed themſelves, and were no way in him indeed: not conſidering that there are degrees, and gradations, and diverſity of implantings: As one into the trunk and ſtock of the tree, another ſtep into the very ſap, ſpirit, or life of it. The former is the mean and way to the latter, and in the latter too there may be gradations, ſome partake of ſpirit ſo far in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they are brought into, <hi>as to bear leaves only,</hi> others <hi>fruits alſo, Matth.</hi> 13.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5, 6.

            <p>Beſide, 2. There is no ſuch cauſe of ſuch confidence as I ſee is uſed in that affirmation of <gap reason="foreign">

And holineſs including chaſtity, fornication, and all abuſe of the veſſel or body might well be thereunto oppoſed. Surely the Apoſtle enlarges the uſe of the body in holineſs further then to chaſtity only as oppoſed to bodily fornication, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Yeild up your members ſervants to righteouſneſs, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> ſignifies but ſo much: Yea holineſs muſt needs be more then chaſtity ſimply conſidered, as oppoſed to adultery, and as it may be a vertue: Amongſt the Gentiles, there were chaſte per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as <hi>Lucretia</hi> and others, but their chaſtity was not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that it is a Church word, attributed to perſons brought forth to and for God, or ſeparated from others to be more peculiarly a people to him: I ſay, when it is attributed to perſons, as when to other things, it is to things ſeparated for God or his Churches uſe; and it is yet to prove, that any perſon is ever in Scripture called holy, that might not be admitted into Gods Congregation, and thereupon be accounted of his Church. I ſhall not ſpend time about what is alledged out of this or that Author, as their Interpretations or Opinions upon either this or the forenamed Scripture.

            <p>With theſe Scriptures, that in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. well agrees, and by them it may be opened: For the Jews being natural branches, and holy by that their branchſhip, were therein alſo children of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo had right to the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the choyce promiſes therein, and to have the means af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded by God for nurture thereunto, which God alſo ſent unto them, and would have had them receive, there being nothing but their own voluntary rejection of them that could or ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them thereof; and that muſt needs do it, for they could not be diſcipled unto and have the Ordinances of Baptiſm and the Supper, &amp;c. unleſs they would yield thereto, and that they would not do, ſo long as they beleeved not that Chriſt was ſent of God, and <hi>the Chriſt</hi> to be baptized unto and ſaved by: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peter</hi> bids them <hi>Repent, and let every one of them be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:112427:56"/> into the Name of the Lord Jeſus for the remiſſion of ſins, and they ſhould receive the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſet before them, <hi>the promiſe being to them and their children, &amp;c.</hi> In which the Apoſtle doth not preſcribe a Rule for all that ſhould be baptized, how much muſt be in every ſuch one before he may be baptized; but tells us what hindered and letted their being baptized into the Name of Chriſt, and ſo coming unto the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> their evil thoughts of Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of him and his Doctrine: So long as they ſtood out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and came not under his Government, they deprived themſelves of the means of their Salvation, and of the promiſes of God; He bids them therefore Repent (or change their thoughts) <hi>viz.</hi> of their unbeleeving and evil carriages towards Chriſt, whoſe Name they hitherto would not own; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they would not own his Name, nor come under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, now to ſubmit to it, and be every one of them baptized to it; even (as I underſtand it) the whole people without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they being all the children of the Covenant, and ſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe being made to them and their children, as to all afar off too, ſo many as ſhould be called to or proſelyted to them; for as yet <hi>Peter</hi> underſtood not the breaking down the partition wall. If we ſhould ſay to the Antipoedobaptiſts, Repent of your concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which cauſes you to make a rent from your Brethren, and be you and yours all ſubject with the reſt of your Brethren to the Name of Chriſt, and baptized into it; we do not therein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a general Rule what all muſt do before Baptiſm, or what others not of their mind ſhould do, or elſe their children could not be baptized; but we exhort them to lay aſide that that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them and theirs from unity in way of nurture and ſubjection to Chriſt with others, ſeeing they may lawfully and ought ſo to be at one, though hitherto they keep at a diſtance through their own miſperſwaſion. It's a ſtrange miſtake that an Exhortation given to ſome who ſtood in their own light, and kept out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from God freely held forth to them, to put away that their evil thought and way, and accept what God tendered them and theirs, and they and theirs had right to look for, ſhould be drawn into a Rule for others in general in whom there is not that way and evil thought by which they endeavor to keep themſelves therefrom, as it's evident in the caſe of the Infants of Chriſtians.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:112427:56"/> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> would have them lay aſide that crooked thought that made them keep themſelves and theirs from Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and ſo from being in the way to enjoy the promiſes; and we would make uſe of it to keep perſons from Baptiſm, and from being under the Inſtitution and Kingdom of Chriſt: He ſaith, <hi>the promiſe was to them and their children;</hi> and the Antipoedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts would build up another partition wall between them and us, and ſay, our children have nothing to do with the promiſe: or of their own heads limit it to children of age only, when here is no ſuch limitation in the Scripture layd down: And to get a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for that, they would have the laſt clauſe, <hi>ſo many as the Lord God ſhall call,</hi> to have relation to all that went before, or at leaſt to that of their children, as well as thoſe afar off: as if either the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> had firſt exhorted that they ſhould every one of them be baptized in the Name of Chriſt, &amp;c. and then afterward have layd down a ground that ſhould poſsibly not include them all, they might happily not be all called; or elſe confound their children with them afar off, and make them as far off from right to look after the promiſe, and from Liberty to the Ordinance, as they that were then afar off: Sure that diſtinction of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and them afar off, was needleſs, if their children were far off from it too. Beſides, it's plain, the Apoſtle reckons the Jews not as already converted, but as Jews not yet caſt off, the children of the Covenant, and makes that both here and in Chap. 3 25. the ground of his calling upon them to repent of that their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt Chriſt, by which they thruſt from them what God had provided for them, and gave them liberty to, and ſo endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered their own breaking off: Yea the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1. For the firſt, I conceive it's clear, that it is added as a reaſon of both the duties exhorted to, and the aſſerting of the benefit propounded as certainly to be met with therein: as if he ſhould ſay, Repent ye of your oppoſition and enmity againſt Jeſus Chriſt, for the promiſe is to you; and by oppoſing and rejecting him, ye deprive your ſelves of the enjoyment thereof: Let every one of you alſo be baptized into his Name for the forgiveneſs of ſins, for the promiſe is to you and to your children; and that Baptiſm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Name will both teſtifie outwardly your repentance of your oppoſitions to him, and will be, if ſincerely on your part ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, a yielding up your ſelves and yours to the Regiment and Order appointed by Jeſus Chriſt for you to walk in for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the promiſe from him, he having received the promiſe to make it good to you, and that being his way in which he will have men wait upon him to make it good to them. And indeed it is more generally and directly the ground of mens being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Chriſt, then of their repenting for their oppoſitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, in this ſence, that it's a ground of repenting more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidently, as they to whom it is propounded, and that are to be ſubjected, diſcipled and baptized into Chriſt, are found actually ſtraying in ſome evil way, from which they muſt firſt turn, and of which they muſt neceſſarily firſt repent, or elſe they cannot be ſubmitters to Chriſt, and be diſcipled and baptized into his Name; as was the caſe of theſe men of grown years, to whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks: ſo that it's the ground and reaſon of calling upon them to repent; as Repentance was the <hi>Removens prohibens,</hi> the removal of the hinderance of ſubmiſſion to Chriſt in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Baptiſm, and in the after-adminiſtration of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to them: Whereas directly the promiſe, and mens title to it (ſuch as is here ſpoken of, and we ſhall by and by explain) gives ground of, and calls for mens ſubmiſsion, and being diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled to Chriſt for the receipt of it, and ſo of being baptized into

Such of them as were from their Infancy trained up in that way of God, and walked righteouſly therein, and upon the firſt hear-ſay of Chriſt cloſed with him, or ſuch as had formerly repented, and walked with God before the hearſay or propoſeal of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Jeſus Chriſt to them, and upon that propoſeal of it kicked not againſt it, or in a word, perſons not needing repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, (as theſe did) yet by the vertue of this promiſe to them in Chriſt, might and ought to yeild up to him, and be diſcipled in his way of Baptiſm for the receit of it from him; And ſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe being to their children, gives ground for their childrens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcipled to Chriſt, by being baptized into his Name, though their children happily were nor, or (their parents ſubmitting to Jeſus Chriſt, and training them up in his nurture) would no need ſo to be ſpoken to, and exhorted to repent, as theſe their parents who had actually ſwerved and gone from the way of God, and rejected it, were, and needed to be exhorted; And ſo we find, <hi>That Cornelius a man fearing God, and Lydia a woman fearing God, and waiting formerly upon God in ſuch ways as they knew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 10.</note> 
               <hi>were baptized:</hi> And therefore no doubt but were alſo inſtructed and exhorted to be baptized into the Name of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Act 16 14, 15.</note> (the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe belonging to them upon Gods call, as well as unto theſe, as appears by the Apoſtles after clauſe in this <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>And to all afar off, ſo many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi>) And yet no mention of calling upon them to repent, that preſuppoſing that the perſons we ſo exhort do actually go on in a wrong and evil way before, which thoſe did not. The foreſaid words are alſo a reaſon and ground of the Apoſtles implying to theſe <hi>Jews</hi> that <hi>They in obeying his counſel, ſhould receive remiſſion of their ſins,</hi> and aſſerting or promiſing their receipt of the gift of the Holy Ghoſt: As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Ye ſhall ſurely in obeying my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, receive the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c. For the promiſe is to you, and to your children, &amp;c.</hi> And truly as it is a reaſon and ground of his aſſerting theſe benefits, as conſequent to their walking in thoſe foreſaid wayes, and ſo of their expectation of them therein, ſo it alſo more ſtrongly lays down ground for their ſo repenting, and letting every one of them be baptized into the Name of Chriſt, that that tends to ſtrengthen men's expectation of good
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:112427:58"/> in ſuch a way neceſſarily tends alſo to bring them into that way. But that it is as well a reaſon of the duty as of the promiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, we may further ſee in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.25. Where the ſame reaſon of their being children of the Covenant, and Chriſt being ſent to bleſs them, is urged by the ſame Apoſtle as a reaſon to prefer their repenting, and being converted, namely to Chriſt, to liſten to him, as to that great Prophet, and ſubmit to his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Ordinances appointed them<note place="margin">Acts 3.19.25, 26.</note> .

            <p n="3">3 By <hi>you and your children,</hi> are meant here the <hi>Jews,</hi> and particularly thoſe he exhorted to repent, and that were pricked in heart, though not ſo bounding up his ſpeech to them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as to take in the body of the people in general, as will be more evident by and by. And by their children, ſuch as were their natural children, begotten and deſcended naturally of them, of what Age or Sex ſoever; for though all ſuch were not the children of God in its prime notion, yet they were all their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, either older, or younger, that were begotten by, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of them. Difference in age or ſex, made no difference as to that matter; therefore no matter though grown men alſo are called the children of their Fathers, for their growth gave them not that Denomination, but their deſcent of them; they were as really their children in infancy, as when ſo grown. So that here is no ground for excluding Infants in their infancy from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comprehended in this expreſſion: The Holy Ghoſt uſing no Note of diſtinction between ſome and other of their children, nor any word that might limit to men grown; he ſays not, <hi>to you and your grown children:</hi> but indefinitely, <hi>to you and your children:</hi> Yea, we find expreſly that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11. (To which the Apoſtle ſeems to me here plainly to allude) the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſo the promiſe of being to them a God, and taking them for his people, (which includes alſo the ſending Chriſt to bleſs them, and give his Spirit to them, for that is part of the work of God, as manifeſting himſelf a God to a people, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them his people) is to the little ones of that people, as well as the reſt. <hi>You ſtand here this day all of you before the Lord your God, your Captains of your Tribes, your Elders, and your Officers, with all the men of Iſrael, your little ones, your wives, and thy ſtranger that is in thy Camp, &amp;c. That thou ſhouldeſt enter into Covenant with the Lord thy God, and into his Oath which the Lord thy God maketh this day with thee, that he may

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with you only, &amp;c. but with him that ſtandeth here with us this day before the Lord our God, and with him that is not here with us this day.</hi> To which clauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to allude in ſaying, <hi>And to all afar off, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, and one clauſe of that Covenant made with them, and their children, even their little ones there, is expreſly in their returning to the Lord, and obeying his voice, (namely in liſtening to the great Prophet, and to the word of faith, as compare <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.11, 12. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8, 9.) <hi>To circumciſe their hearts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 30 6.</note> 
               <hi>and the hearts of their ſeed to love the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Which how is it done but by the giving forth his Spirit in his Church, and Ordinances to them? And what is it in ſubſtance, but that in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt God having raiſed up Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way every one of you from your iniquities?</hi> Which though now at this time they almoſt generally rejected, yet in their turning in again, ſhall be performed to them, and their children,<note place="margin">Mark 10.16.</note> as he did actually give his bleſſing to thoſe little children that came (that is, were brought) to him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To that, how this promiſe was to them, and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Let me ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively: Not ſo as it was to Chriſt, who had actually and immeaſurably received upon his Aſcenſion the Promiſe of the Spirit in the man, or nature of men, to communicate to them in liſtening to, and obeying him, and who is the Store-houſe, and way of making out all the promiſes of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. So they neither had, nor could have the promiſe to them, or their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Nor if, were the things promiſed <hi>abſolutely</hi> theirs, nor the promiſe as made in an abſolute form ſo, or upon ſuch terms, as that they muſt certainly, and without fail receive the Holy Ghoſt, and the Bleſſing of Chriſt, whether they repented of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and obſtinacy, yea, or no, or were diſcipled to him, and baptized into his Name, or not; for that would rather have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined the Apoſtles counſel to them, then have added ſtrength to it, making their Repentance and Baptiſm needleſs to them, or their children. Now many of them, though called, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.15. children of the Covenant, and though Chriſt was ſent to them
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:112427:60"/> to bleſs them, not hearkening to the great Prophet, received not his bleſſing, but were broken off, and wrath came heavily upon them. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Poſitively, and Affirmatively. The promiſe was to them, and their children, becauſe they were made by way of propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, and the propoſal of them, and ſo the promiſe, or promiſes, as ſo made, were given to them, and their children, as their ſtanding priviledge in which they were preferred before all people, who in that reſpect were ſtrangers to the Covenants of promiſe,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.12.</note> and knew them not, nor were born or educated up under the hope, and in the way of enjoyment of them. Thus <hi>their's was the adoption,</hi> they were choſen to be a people nearer to God,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.21, 22.</note> and had his Name put upon them, (as the fathers name is on his child) and God more eſpecially owned, and cared for them, and they were born and educated in the Kingdom of God, where his Bleſſing and Spirit was converſant for teaching and bringing them to be the children of God by faith and regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And ſo <hi>theirs was the glory,</hi> they had the manifeſtations of Gods glory amongſt them, and were honoured above all other people; <hi>theirs were the Covenants,</hi> to them made, with them left, that they might be trained up in the knowledge of them: So <hi>theirs was the giving of the Law, and the Service, or way of Gods worſhip, and the promiſes;</hi> they were promulgated to them, and they were brought up under the hope of them, being children of the Kingdom, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They were made as the choice things promiſed <hi>conditionally</hi> with them, ſo as that they ſubmitting themſelves, and training up theirs to, and for God, according to his will manifeſted to them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the Prophets, and now by the Great Prophet Jeſus, he would be a God to them and theirs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.7. do all to and for them that was needful to be done of God for making them his people, a people every way happy, and ſo now ſent his Son to them, (having died for them) to bleſs them, in turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way every one of them from their ſins, which bleſſing, even the forgiveneſs of their former ſins againſt him, and wickedneſs againſt Chriſt in crucifying him, and the Holy Ghoſt to be preſent with, and bleſs them and theirs, according to their ſeveral capacities; if they would repent of their wickedneſs, and every one of them be ſubject to his Government, being baptized into his Name,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:112427:60"/> they ſhould receive: otherwiſe they to be cut off from the Congregation of God, and from the Bleſſings promiſed them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By what hath been ſaid, It appears how or upon account the promiſe was to them, and their children: not in reſpect of any particular birth, repentance, or faith, or the like, in the ſences e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now cleared: for this is aſſerted concerning them, not by way of promiſe, as ſomething that ſhould accrue to them by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, and being every one of them baptized, (only the things promiſed they ſhould actually receive in ſo doing) but as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ground to move them to repent, and be baptized. Was it to them, as <hi>they were pricked in their hearts;</hi> for the ſame is affirmed of them in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.25. that were not as then ſo pricked, that we have any mention in the leaſt of, yea, of thoſe for whom the Apoſtle had great ſorrow, and heavineſs of heart, as actually rejecting their own mercies, and not attaining the bleſſings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, yet <hi>theirs,</hi> alſo ſays he, <hi>are the promiſes, Rom.</hi> 9.4. But as they were the ſeed or family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> either lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Jacob,</hi> as the natural <hi>Jews,</hi> or adopted, or proſely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto, as the Proſelytes of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (and ſuch as were here amongſt the people that <hi>Peter</hi> preach'd to, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.10.) by vertue of Gods having called and choſen them, <hi>the Family of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, to be to himſelf an holy people, Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8, 9. And ſo as they ſprung from, or grew upon that holy root, that was holy by vertue of Gods call and account, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. So they are called <hi>natural branches, though by their actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al unbelief after broken off:</hi> So even their children were born to God, and owned as his. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, 21. <hi>Children of the Kingdom, and members of Gods Congregation, or Church:</hi> as appears by this,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.14.</note> 
               <hi>That they not being circumciſed at eight dayes old in the times of the Law, they are ſaid to be cut off from the Congregation:</hi> that is, they were exempted from being Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, or having the Priviledges and Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as pertaining to them, ſo as to be enjoyed by them. In other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, they could not be called <hi>natural branches,</hi> or <hi>children of the Kingdom,</hi> as we have ſeen, <hi>being by nature,</hi> as in themſelves, <hi>children of wrath,</hi> as well as, and no better then others, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. Their Infants then, as their Infants born in, and to the Church of God, were members of the Church, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:112427:61"/> according to their capacities with them in their priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, The Covenants, Promiſes, Adoption, Glory, pertained to them, and they were concerned in them, and had their ſhare of bleſſing in them, and in Chriſt alſo who was of them, ſent to them, and refuſed not to bleſs them, as we have ſeen, they being brought to him, and brought up in his way, Ordinances, and Appointments in his Kingdom; of which bleſſing they only were deprived by their parents unbelief, as not bringing them to Chriſt, or diſcipling them to him,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.14.</note> and ſo bringing them into his Church, and Kingdom, or (and that more eſpecially) by their own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary refuſing to liſten to that Great Prophet, when they grew up to be capable of underſtanding, and following after him, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22, 23. which may yet be further ſeen in what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>viz.</hi>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:112427:61"/> to them, and ſent to them to bleſs them as the <hi>Jews</hi> had: <hi>And they were aliens from the Commonwealth of Iſrael,</hi> even from thoſe priviledges, and more ſpecial means of Grace and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, with the preſence and bleſſing of God, and Spirit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had afforded to them, and to all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyted to them in common: And ſo <hi>they were ſtrangers from the Covenant of promiſes;</hi> then it follows, the <hi>Jews</hi> and their children were not ſo, for otherwiſe they ſhould be afar off too, and the diſtinction between their children and them afar off ſhould be groundleſs, and come to nothing: No, they were to them and their children, the other, were neither born under, nor brought up to the knowledge and hope of them; fathers and children were without them, and ſo by conſequent without hope, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had not that hope for their children, nor for themſelves, that the promiſe held forth for and to men, and as the <hi>Jews</hi> had, or might have had in minding and believing them: they being <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God,</hi> that is, the knowledge of God, and the Covenant of God, and ſo God had not engaged himſelf to them, to be with them, and their children, to bleſs and keep, and protect and own them, as he was the God of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whence alſo their hope for themſelves and theirs ſprung. So that by this alſo, it yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appears, that the children of the <hi>Jews</hi> as ſuch by vertue of his foreſaid choice and calling them, and ſo (the partition wall being broken down) the children of the Proſelytes and Diſciples of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ſuch, as to whom the promiſe was, into which Baptiſm as an Ordinance of Chriſt, further admitted, and was one way or ſtep toward the meeting with the performance of, and therefore they to be baptized, and nurtured to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of it. And laſtly,</p>
            <p n="7">7. By this it alſo appears, why and whereto that is added, <hi>So many as the Lord our God ſhall call to.</hi> Namely, that it ſpeaks to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> becauſe they being far off could not have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, either propounded to them, or ſet before them to follow after it; nor conditionally made with them and theirs, much leſs could they enjoy that bleſſing in Chriſt promiſed, neither call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, nor be ſaved, unleſs called by God to Chriſt in his Church. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. The Call of God by ſending the Goſpel to them, preaching peace to them, and inviting them to come in, was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſufficient for their having the promiſe to them, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:112427:62"/> ſence, and ſo much only the word <hi>call</hi> often ſignifies, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.2, 3, 4. Though the being called of God, ſo as to be prevailed with to believe and obey, where capacity is given, is needful for the enjoyment of the bleſſings promiſed: Theſe <hi>Jews</hi> with their children had the promiſe to them already, and before this, as we have fully ſhewed, and were not now to call, to have them made in that ſence to them, in which it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, It was then (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to them, they were called hereto in Gods calling <hi>Abraham,</hi> and calling his ſeed in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and in his calling them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to himſelf, and making his Covenant and promiſes further with them, and in all the Prophets, and Chriſt, and his Apoſtles calling them, and their children were called in their fathers being called with them, as when they were called out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> As generally, when God calls parents to his Church, he calls theirs under their tuition with them; Thence the <hi>Salvation of God,</hi> (the means of ſalvation, that is at leaſt) is ſaid, <hi>to come to the houſe, or houſhold,</hi> not to them of underſtanding, or that actually believe only; and they are to bring up theirs in the way of the Lord, and diſciple them to him, or worſhip him with them, as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> ſays, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. But the unproſelyted <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not as yet (the body of them) called to the Church, the Commiſſion only was given forth, (the partition wall being broken down) for calling and diſcipling, baptizing them, and not circumciſing them, as before, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20.</p>
            <p>Sum up all this together then, and we ſee its clear, That the promiſe was to their children, one and other, till they wilfully put it away, and they, even the leaſt of them, were therein near to God, capable of Chriſts bleſſing them, and ſo had that that is here laid down as the ground and motive for being baptized into Chriſts Name, for the forgiveneſs of the ſin of their Nature, ſo as to own them, and care for them, that notwithſtanding, as his upon whom he had put his Name, and ſo of having the Holy Ghoſt to be with them, and circumciſe their hearts, and ſanctifie them, as they grew more and more capable thereof. That they were of the Lords Congregation, and it was the <hi>Jews</hi> ſin, both againſt themſelves and their children, to oppoſe and put from them Jeſus Chriſt, which they ought to have repented of, that every one of them being baptized into his Name, and ſo ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him, they might receive the promiſe now brought nigh,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:112427:62"/> and tendred to them by Chriſt in his coming. To which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that (which the Scriptures, and we from them, have before ſhewed) <hi>That the partition wall is broken down, and we Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that were afar off, are now made nigh by the blood of Chriſt, called to be partakers of his promiſe by the Goſpel,</hi> as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.4.6. Then it will roundly follow, That our children now are as near as theirs were then, and ſo are of Gods Congregation, are children of the Covenant and Kingdom by inſition, (though not by natural deſcent from <hi>Abraham</hi>) and ſo have the true ground of Baptiſm, the Seal of that promiſe, way of admiſſion into the outward Court of Gods Kingdom, into his Church, and under his promiſe and bleſſing now to us, as Circumciſion was before Chriſts Aſcenſion, and the badg of difference between the Church, and Congregation of God, and them that are ſtrangers to his Church and Covenant, and to deny or defer it to them, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray our ignorance of Gods grace and gracious mind toward them, and to cut them off, or keep them out of Gods Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo from the bleſſing of Chriſt, there to be diſpenſed to them. And I pray God help the Antipedobaptiſts to ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the injury they do to themſelves and their children, ſo would they repent of their miſtaken zeal, and be as zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their abuſe of this, and other Scriptures, as now they are againſt Infant-baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Whereas they object, <hi>That only they that heard the word gladly were baptized, ver.</hi> 41.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>That they were baptized that heard the word glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> is certainly affirmed, but he that ſhall turn it, and ſay, That all that were there baptized, did gladly receive the word, ſhall ſpeak as much beyond what he can prove, as he that ſuppoſes it might be otherwiſe. Children are often included tacitely in their parents, at leaſt in paſſive matters ſpoken of through the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe concerned in thoſe paſſive matters, may be by ſuch acts as only ſute to the parents, or thoſe of years only. As its ſaid, <hi>That the Lord removed Iſrael out of his ſight, and the King of Aſſyria carried Iſrael captive:</hi> and the reaſon is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>That Iſrael had ſinned againſt their God, and walked in the ſtatutes of the Heathen, and built them high places, and ſet up Images:</hi> which things Infants were not capable of acting in, and yet they are without all doubt included in what is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:112427:63"/> affirmed of them for Gods removing them, and their being led captive, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. So in <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. <hi>Simeon and Levi, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> (though fainedly) <hi>a Covenant with Hamor and Sechem, requires that every male of them be circumciſed,</hi> (which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly included not them they ſpake with only, but their children, and Infants too, as every one of you in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.37. may do.) And in <hi>ver.</hi> 24. its ſaid, <hi>All that went out of the gate of their City, hearkened unto Hamor and Sechem, and every male was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, all that went out of the gate of the City.</hi> Shall we ſay, that becauſe its ſaid, All that went out of the gate of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hearkened unto <hi>Hamor,</hi> and they were all circumciſed that went out of the gate of the City, therefore all that were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed did actually hearken to, or conſent to <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Sechem,</hi> and that no child or infant, but ſuch as were able to go out of the gate of the City, and to give actual conſent to <hi>Hamor,</hi> were circumciſed; ſurely it will not follow. So <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 10.6. its ſaid, <hi>Our Fathers provoked God at the red Sea, yet God ſaved them, and led them through the red Sea,</hi> (in which the Apoſtle tells us. <hi>They were baptized into Moſes,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2.) And it follows, <hi>That they then believed his word, and ſang his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, even Moſes, and the children of Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 15.1. And yet I think no man will thence gather, that only thoſe that provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God at the Sea, or that after believed, and ſang praiſes, were ſaved, and led through the Sea. Many other inſtances might be given to the ſame purpoſe, ſo that nothing can be thence conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from what is ſaid of thoſe that are mentioned to have been baptized, that will inforce a ſtraitening of the right to Baptiſm to ſuch qualified perſons; which is alſo rather to be ſought and minded what it is from the grounds of it as laid down in Scripture, then from what is expreſſed as to the practiſe of it.</p>
            <p>That Scripture oft mentioned by us, in what we have ſaid to this of <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>viz. Acts</hi> 3.25. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>That in the ſeed of Abraham all the Families of the Earth ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> may come in for another Evidence to the point in hand by it ſelf, for what doth it ſignifie leſs then that, <hi>In Jeſus Chriſt (he through his death as a Ranſom for all,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>And Reſurrection from the dead, having anſwered the Law, aboliſhed death for all, and ſo become Lord of all, and the propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, Gal.</hi> 3.13. 2

Let us then examine what may be ſaid for, and what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
            <p>The Scope of the place favours it, thus: <hi>Nicodemus coming to Chriſt by night, and confeſſing him a Teacher ſent of God:</hi> our Saviour inſtructs him what was needful for ſeeing, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and enjoying, and entering into the Kingdom of God that he preached; Namely, That he muſt not reſt in what he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in <hi>Moſes</hi> Miniſtration, but ſubmit to him whom God had more actually ſent forth to be the Saviour of the world, to receive a New-birth from him in his Miniſtration, without which no enterance for any one (as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies) into that Kingdom. Now that which he did in his Miniſtration for admitting and leading men into that Kingdom, we know was together with his Doctrine, baptizing with water by his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>John</hi> 3.21.22. and 4.1, 2. And with the Holy Ghoſt more immediately by himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 7.37, 38. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5. And unleſs a man ſubmitted to him in both theſe Adminiſtrations, he could not enter into the Kingdom of God, as ſet up of God in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment and ordering.</p>
            <p>The Order of the words in ſetting water before ſpirit, ſuits with the Order of thoſe Adminiſtrations of his twofold Baptiſm. Baptiſm with water uſually (yea alwayes that we read of, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in that extraordinary caſe of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> of which we have given an account elſewhere) going before the pouring out of his Spirit, As <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. &amp; 8.16, 17. &amp; 19.4, 5.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:112427:64"/> Where alſo that Ordinance of laying on of hands, in which the more viſible and evident givings of the Spirit was vouchſafed after Baptiſm, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.16, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Interpretation agreeth with that in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. whereby by moſt Interpreters Baptiſm is called the Laver of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and I conceive it is not to be excluded in that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Text will run as well or better this way, then in and according to other Interpretations: For to view them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some by water think the Spirit to be ſignified by an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, like that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.12. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt, and fire;</hi> but this looks too like a Tautalogy, it amounting but to Spirit and Spirit; that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.12. may admit of a better Expoſition: <hi>viz.</hi> by fire, to ſignifie <hi>fiery trials,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13, 14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12, 13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. I know it is ſaid, that by water is ſignified, <hi>the cleanſing operation of the Spirit,</hi> and ſo it amounts to, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born of the Spirit, and his cleanſing operation.</hi> But then water ſhould be rather ſet after ſpirit, then before it. To ſay nothing that all that yet amounts but to ſpirit for her being holy, the birth of him muſt needs produce holineſs or clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs too.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others (as I my ſelf have) underſtand by water the grace of God, as held forth in the Goſpel, and received by faith, the word, grace, and knowledge of God being in Scriptures often ſo called, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.1, 2, 3. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.9. with <hi>Joel</hi> 3.18. And this indeed would well agree to men of years, but how will it reach the extent of the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) any one, which reaches to every Sex and Age?

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> There is a ſymbolical or ſimilitudinary, yea, and ſomething more then ſimilitudinary birth in Baptiſm, for as in every birth (taking the word in that large ſenſe before declared) there is a <hi>Corruptio unius formae, &amp; productio alterius;</hi> a paſſing from one to another form, or manner of being. So in this Ordinance of Baptiſm there is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Significant,</hi> letting go, dying to, or renouncing all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rights, titles, or claims to Gods Kingdom, as ſet up in the Miniſtration of Chriſt, whether from natural-birth from <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> or ſpiritual or ſymbolical birth by Circumciſion, and the Ordinances of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Though the Kingdom of God be for, and is tendred to men as born of <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the circumciſed were the children of it, as to right of its tender
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:112427:65"/> to them, and their duty to receive it, yet the Kingdom and the bleſſings of it by way of receit and enjoyment, they could not, nor might have abiding but in that condition, or under that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, to receive the Kingdom; they muſt paſs further, be born from above, that is, of water, &amp;c. be baptized, in which was,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A putting on, and being brought into a new kind of being, title, and claim to the Kingdom of God, a putting on Chriſt as come in the fleſh, and bringing by his death for all men life, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and bleſſing through the free grace of God unto them. <hi>For in being baptized into the Name of Chriſt is a putting on of Jeſus Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3.26, 27. ſymbolically, profeſſedly, and as to obligation to him, and to worſhip God by him. Something of the ſome nature was in Circumciſion, whence I conceive our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour reprehends <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> his groſs ignorance and miſtake of his meaning, ſaying, <hi>Art thou a Maſter in Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things? John</hi> 3.10. For in Circumciſion there was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately a renouncing of all claim to the bleſſing of God by any natural birth of <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any thing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whence the foreskin of their generation was cut off, and an owning or coming in unto a new birth or being, namely, to have a being in Chriſt of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as promiſed to him, and ſo in the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> promiſing bleſſing to all the families of the earth through him. Only that that gave title to the bleſſing as promiſed, would not ſuffice to give title to the exhibition of it, the being brought into the Covenant, and ſo into Chriſt as promiſed, ſerved to bring into the Church, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Miniſtration of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the bleſſings ſuitable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but to the Kingdom of God preached and adminiſtred by Chriſt come in the fleſh. It was needful to be born of water, that is, to be baptized into him, as ſo come in the fleſh, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There alſo there is ſome Analogy in Baptiſm to the cuſtoms uſed upon new-born perſons in nature, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>There is a waſhing of the Infant new-born before it be fit to be educated, or nouriſhed amongſt perſons that are clean.</hi> So here the party to be baptized by his ſubmiſſion to Chriſt, is made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of a new birth, or title to the Kingdom, and is waſhed; to ſignifie that Chriſt forgives ſins to the ſubmitter to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:112427:66"/> on him: Like as amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> If any <hi>Heathen</hi> family ſubmitted to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion formerly, <hi>they were all beſide Circumciſion of the males, baptized or waſhed.</hi> See <hi>Ainſw.</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12. <hi>For being by the ſubmiſſion of the parents to the Law, as it were new-born to that Religion, they were dealt with as new-born Infants, waſhed, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, ſuch a right we find to have been practiſed amongſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> (the Devil imitating ſometimes Gods Ordinances) that if one had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out to have been dead, and his Funeral ſolemnized, if it was found afterward that he was alive, and appeared amongſt them again, they looked upon him as unclean and abominable, not fit to joyn with them civil, much leſs their religious fellowſhips, till (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Oracle, Given at <hi>Delphos</hi> to one <hi>Ariſtinus,</hi> whom ſuch a Diſaſter befel,

            <p n="3">3. Whereas this birth is not only of water, but of water and ſpirit, there is this tendency therein further to the birth of ſpirit, That,</p>

               </gap>, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>If I have ſpoken to thee of things on earth.</hi> So then by the Kingdom of God here is ſignified, <hi>the Kingdom preached and adminiſtred by Chriſt on the earth, or in his life.</hi> In which as we have ſhewed before is a twofold ſtate, External, and into that no man can enter ſo as to be reputed, and taken as a member of it, as now ordered by Chriſt come in the fleſh, but by being baptized with water, into that <hi>Cornelius</hi> entered not otherwiſe, nor the thief entered at all, if not formerly baptized of <hi>John,</hi> as none can tell but he might be.</p>
            <p>Internal, and into that none can enter, but by being <hi>born of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that is, by being brought into, and united unto Chriſt by him, ſo as to have him the only hope of glory, the only righteouſneſs, redemption, life, and ſo to have our dependance on, and rejoycing in him, and God through him. This twofold principle of birth then may have more direct reference to the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſtate of it, as here adminiſtred. And yet as <hi>Cornelius</hi> entered in ſome meaſure into the ſecond, before he had the admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the firſt; ſo may a man poſſibly be admitted into that eſtate, that is not here on earth to be enjoyed without it; but to enter it in both its eſtates here, both are required to be born of water, and the ſpirit. Beſides,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, cannot, does not always ſignifie an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute impoſſibility, but only an unuſualneſs, or an inconſiſtency with ſuch ordinary ways, or principles. As when its ſaid, <hi>The children of the Bride-chamber cannot faſt, ſo long as the Bride-groom it with them, Matth.</hi> 2.19. So it cannot be, <hi>that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet periſh out of Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 13.23. <hi>He could there do no mighty works becauſe of their unbelief, Mark</hi> 6.5. <hi>The world cannot hate you, John</hi> 7.7. with divers others. Which are to be interpreted ſome of them, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, ſome of them, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, its not uſual, or inſiſtent with ſuch principles, or ways appointed. So here a man cannot in an ordinary way enter into the Kingdom of God, the Regiment of God by Chriſt here, and ſo meet with the bleſſings and priviledges diſpenſed by him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:112427:67"/> baptized with water, and with the Holy Ghoſt: Nor yet may it be ſaid, That Baptiſm giving an admiſſion, what need then of the Holy Ghoſt too.</p>
            <p>For, 1. The outward Baptiſm, as outward, gives but admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into its outward ſtate, though therein it brings into the way for meeting with Spirit, and ſo the inward ſtate of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The outward Baptiſm, as was outed above, is not without the preſence and bleſſing of the Spirit in ſome meaſure, where not guilfully or deceitfully received.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, doth not only ſignifie, the firſt ſtepping into, but alſo the paſsing on into the thing entred, and ſo a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued act of entering, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. <hi>We that have believed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, do enter into reſt;</hi> we are yet but entering, And ſo in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.3.8, 9. <hi>Such are in part entered,</hi> as the Diſciples were, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.11. <hi>Yet unleſs they do put away, and turn from ſuch evils as they occaſionally are corrupted with, and are offended by, they cannot <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, enter, or paſs on, but will ſtop in the paſſage, and at length be caſt out again.</hi> As it was needful then for <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> entred into the internal ſtate in part to be baptized with water, for entering the outward ſtate of the Kingdom of Chriſt. So its needful for thoſe that have been baptized, and entered the outward; yea, and begun to enter the inward too, to yeild up to Chriſt his Doctrine, Reproofs, Counſels, that they may <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, paſs into the inward farther, and ſo be prepared for the eternal ſtate of it in its glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though we cannot conclude then, That no outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, no ſalvation, yet the ordinary paſſage into the inward ſtate of Chriſts Kingdom here, being by the outward, and ſo through both into the ſtate of eternal Glory, I think we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to be deſperate folly and madneſs, for men to neglect the entering into this Kingdom in its outward ſtate, either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or theirs, preſuming to enter the inner and future ſtate without thar. If this be the way of enterance without which no ordinary enterance, Who will be ſo mad to put himſelf or his, upon an extraordinary, when the ordinary is before him, and may be had? It being not Gods way to work extraordinarily, where his ordinary ways or Ordinances may be enjoyed, and are ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Indeed, where God denyes the ordinary means, we may hope his mercy and goodneſs diſpenſes with the wants in men,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:112427:67"/> they ſeeking and hoping in him according to what they have, but no ground for thinking ſo, where the ordinary means are ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, appointed for us by him; in ſuch a caſe a man neglecting Gods way of entering into the Church or Kingdom of God, or bringing his thereinto, cuts himſelf or his off, as we have cited before from Gods Congregation, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. And though there be bleſſing for all men, Nations and Families in Chriſt, yet where he hath promiſed that it ſhall come upon men to eternal life, and enjoyment of his Kingdom in its glorious ſtate, where through unbelief, or ſlighting it, men do not enter it in what eſtates of it are here to be entered; I know not, nor believe I, that any man can demonſtrate to me. Indeed, the poor Infants of ſuch perſons cannot help it in themſelves in Infancy, nor could they under the ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt, and though I know no promiſe of ſalvation to them in ſuch a caſe, we may hope that the mercy of God would not impute it to them to an eternal rejection of them, but in ſuch a caſe the parents ingage Gods diſpleaſure againſt themſelves, and ſo do all ſuch as be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to ſuch their actions;<note place="margin">Exod. 4.24, 25, 26. Mark 10.14.</note> and I ſee not but God alſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them in their children in threatning to cut them off from the enjoyment of ſuch bleſſing, as here they might in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom meet with on the earth; That ſoul that is not entered into the Covenant of Gods bleſſing in Chriſt, being cut off from, and ſo not reputed or dealt with by God as one of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. So that there is now as the bleſſings of Gods Kingdom here on earth both to the parents and children of their being baptized, and ſo born of water, though there be not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity as to eternal ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And now let us ſum up that which hath been hitherto ſaid for it, and we may put it into theſe following Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All the Nations, or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are within the Commiſsion, <hi>for diſcipling, by baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> Or thus, <hi>Chriſt hath commanded to diſciple all the Gentiles, baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> But our little Infants are alſo <hi>Gentiles,</hi> therefore to be diſcipled, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What the Apoſtles practiſed in baptizing, we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; But they baptized believers with their houſholds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception of any, becauſe children, that we read of; therefore ſo may we.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:112427:68"/>3. If the Kingdom of Heaven ſignifying, or including the Church-ſtate, is not to be denyed to little children, then neither is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. But the Kingdom of Heaven including the Church-ſtate, is not to be denyed them, becauſe of ſuch it is, therefore not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the Infants of parents that are the branches of the ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> be not broken off from that ſtock, until, or unleſs they come to renounce that faith and profeſſion of his, or in his family, then they are till then to be acknowledged as holy, and as branches, and not deprived of the badge of that acknowledgement, that is Baptiſm: But the Infants of ſuch Parents, are not broken off, till, or unleſs they come to renounce that faith and profeſſion: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If the promiſe of God appertains to children with their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and the bleſſing of Chriſt belong to whole families, except in caſe of wilful rejection, and ſuch right of it to them be ground of their coming to, and receiving Baptiſm, then are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be baptized with their parents. But ſo it is as we have ſeen. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. If children have need of entering into the Kingdom of God for his bleſſing, and the way of entering be by Baptiſm, then need and ought they to be baptized; but the promiſes are true, as we have ſeen, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, he that will implead, and cry out againſt Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, muſt prove,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That children are not included in all the Nations, or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> to be diſcipled by baptizing them; or that they cannot ſo be diſcipled.</p>
            <p>And 2. That the Apoſtles baptized not ſuch houſholds as in which were Infants, or in caſe they did, they yet left out the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in them.</p>
            <p>And 3. That when our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> the word <hi>ſuch</hi> ſignifies not ſuch in kind, or the Kingdom of Heaven, as there mentioned, includeth not its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Regiment, or that that may be theirs, and they admitted to it, and come to Chriſt in it, and yet not be baptized.</p>
            <p>And 4. That the Infants of believers, or of perſons not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the ſtock of <hi>Abraham</hi> are unbranched, till actual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, or may not have the outward Baptiſm, and be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:112427:68"/> members of the Church, though not unbranched. I ſay, theſe and the like things are needful to be proved, which I conceive a very hard task for him that ſhall reject Infants from Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>There are I confeſs, yet ſome other Objections againſt it, as that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It occaſions great diſorder, and confuſion in the Church of God, filling it with dead unprofitable members, and profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, That,</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no great Antiquity for it, or not ſuch as is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That however the form that is now uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> of not plunging into, but onely waſhing, or ſprinkling with water, cannot be allowed to have the eſſential form of right Baptiſm in it. To all which, I ſhall ſay a word or two particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Its ſaid, Infant-Baptiſm brings in a ſwarm of ignorant and profane perſons, that have nothing but the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, 1. That it cannot be denied indeed, that many evil men are in the Church of God, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>Tares as well as wheat, many that do iniquity, good and bad are in the net.</hi> Yea, and this is to me an Argument of the vanity of thoſe that go up and down to rebaptize, and gather into themſelves thereby, as if they were not in the Church, or Kingdom of Chriſt, till diſcipled by their Baptiſm, when as they may be in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Church of Chriſt, though workers of iniquity in it: The <hi>Gentiles</hi> are within the outward Court, and its given to them; and its a vain thing for men to ſay, its not the outward Court of Gods Temple, becauſe they be <hi>Gentile</hi>-multitudes that be in it: Nor may any ſay, the Kingdom ſpoken of in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41. is the <hi>Kingdom of Providence, becauſe the field is ſaid to be in the world:</hi> For then ſhould they be gathered out of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Government, which they cannot be; for even hell it ſelf is under the <hi>Kingdom of Power and Providence,</hi> which ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth over all. <hi>The world indeed is the field, but the field is not the Kingdom; the Kingdom is in the field, or world, but its not the world.</hi> Its the Church-ſtate in which they are, and in which they offend, and do iniquity, and from thence they ſhall be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:112427:69"/> gathered, they need not then another Baptiſm of water to bring them into the Kingdom, or Church-ſtate, in its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court, or external form; for they are in it already: But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The reaſon of mens being ſuch bad members in it, is not Infants-baptiſm, the Infants I am ſure are leaſt in the fault, or their being baptized. If it were, yet we ſee there began to be ſuch in the Apoſtles time, and therefore if Infant baptiſm be the cauſe, that was then too, there were then divers that had not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.1.2. and 15.34. James 2.17. 2 Tim. 3.5. 1 Tim. 6.4, 5, 6</note> and that judged and walked carnally, dead Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>that had a form, but not the power of godlineſs, men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith, contentious, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, brangling perſons, ſome that would be drunk in their very ſolemn meetings.</hi> And the further the ſtream runs from the fountain, the more mud and corruption it contracts: but the truth is,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.21.</note> the cauſe of this diſſoluteneſs in the Church, is rather mens ſleeping, that is, their careleſneſs in attending to Doctrine and Diſcipline; Parents have been neglective of training up their children in the Nurture of the Lord, and Church-cenſure, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, and Excommunication have been laid aſide, or abuſed, otherwiſe, the Church had not come to this corruption. Not the admiſſion of children then by Baptiſm, but want of careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in members of elder years for diſciplinating their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and of the Church for warning, watching over, and caſting out, have been the true cauſes of ſo much rubbiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This might be retorted upon the Antipedobaptiſts, the evil conſequences and fruits that frequently follow upon it. Not to mention the buſineſs of <hi>Munſter,</hi> too much talked of, our own Country affords too much of the ſad conſequences that have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in many upon their rejecting their former, and betaking themſelves to another Baptiſm; as their growing to ſlight their brethren, though gracious, and formerly ſo approved; their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off from Ordinances, yea, from Chriſt himſelf, and turning ſome of them to be little leſs then Atheiſts: but for the fuller o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening and ſpeaking to theſe ſad things, I refer the Reader to a Book upon this ſubject, lately ſet out by my godly Brother, <hi>T. M.</hi> Surely <hi>John</hi> intimates that into the floor of Chriſt, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptiſm, there would enter chaff as well as wheat, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:112427:69"/> therefore if the Commiſſion take in all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of what Ages, or Sex, or Country ſoever, we may not exclude infants, becauſe through ſome neglects, and want of vigilancy, many of them prove ignorant and vitious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For ancient Writers upon this point, Maſter <hi>Marſhal</hi> hath to my hand produced divers, as <hi>Ireneus, Origen, Nazianzen, Cyprian, Auguſtine, Ambroſe, &amp;c.</hi> The firſt indeed hath not the word <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> but <hi>renewing</hi> rather, his Latine phraſe is thus, <hi>Omnes qui per cum renaſcuntur in Deum, infantes, &amp; parvu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, &amp; pueros, &amp; juvenes.</hi> Which ſome object againſt,<note place="margin">Mr <hi>Tombes.</hi>
               </note> as if he ſpake of Sanctification, not Baptiſm: When as yet Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſignifies a devoting to God, and we read not that the Ancients eſteemed any ſo, not of the Church, or not admittable to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: yea, its a confeſt thing that they uſed the word <hi>Renaſci,</hi> to ſignifie to be baptized, and accounted ſuch to be <hi>Renatos.</hi> Its ſaid again, That poſſibly <hi>Ireneus</hi> being a Greek writer, had ſome other word or phraſe then what ſutes with his Latine Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations. But that's a meer vanity as to matter of diſproof of what we have in the Tranſlations, if any Copies of him could be ſhewed that ſpeak otherwiſe, it were ſomething to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Origen,</hi> its true, he had his Errours as all the Fathers had, but ſure he was without errour able to ſay what was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Church in his time, and that's all that we ſeek for from the Fathers to this buſineſs: He muſt be a notorious falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, if he ſhould wilfully miſreport the Churches known practiſes, and we ſhould have found ſome ſo honeſt, as to have cried ſhame upon him for it. Indeed, ſome ſuſpect thoſe paſſages not to be his, but <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his; which yet at the moſt is but ſuſpicion. The moſt ancient Writers that we have, have delivered nothing to the contrary: as if Infant-baptiſm was not in their times practiſed, or as if it were unlawful (however in caſes of ſickneſs and death approaching) to practiſe it.</p>
            <p>The reſt are more plainly and undeniably for it, eſpecially <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> who lived about 240 years after Chriſt, and with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of 66 Biſhops determined that Infants were to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and ſurely we can ſcarce imagine, that ſo many Biſhops ſhould all be ignorant of what was the practiſe of the Church for divers years before that their determination; yea, had it been
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:112427:70"/> ſome innovation, its not probable, but in thoſe more fervent times for Chriſt, in which ſo many ſuffered gloriouſly for him, ſome would have detected and cryed out upon them. As we ſee they did oppoſe <hi>Cyprian</hi> in point of rebaptizing Hereticks. But then againſt them there are two things objected.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That their grounds were rotten upon which they maintained that Doctrine and practiſe, as if no children could be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, 1. That the Ancients have miſtaken the grounds of the moſt undeniable practiſes: As of Baptiſm it ſelf in general, though to men of years, and upon profeſſion of faith, as if it was of the ſame abſolute <note n="*" place="margin">Praeſcribitur nemini ſine Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmo competere ſalutem, ex il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </note> neceſſity to ſalvation, and as if it blotted out, or took away, in whom ever original ſin, yea, in men of years, all other ſins too. Shall we therefore ſay, They were wrong in holding forth any ſuch thing as Baptiſm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they miſtook its grounds; the like we might ſay of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, &amp;c. The practiſe of the Church they might better underſtand then the grounds of thoſe practiſes. It cannot be proved, that any of them were the bringers in of thoſe practiſes, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnators of them already, and before times in uſe; only they grew ſuperſtitious in their conceits of thoſe practiſes, as may be ſeen in others of undenyable Apoſtolical inſtitution, as the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ground that <hi>Cyprian</hi> gives, <hi>viz. Nemini Dei gratia deneganda eſt, &amp;c.</hi> is indeed the bottom right ground of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them. For Chriſts deſcending into the waters of affliction, yea into death it ſelf in behalf of all, his riſing again is that which is both the ground of Goſpel-preaching to all, and affirming the good will of God to all men, <hi>That he would have them ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13, 14, 15. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4 6. And the ground of all mens being obliged to him, to live to him that dyed for them, he being by that means <hi>the Lord of all, Rom.</hi> 14.9. And the door of hope ſet open to all, the paſſage through which God tendreth his grace in the Goſpel, and extendeth his mercy and goodneſs to all one and other, and alſo the very ground of opening his Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-ſeated amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> unto all the Nations, and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and commanding all to be baptized into his Name, by baptizing them thereinto, and ſetting his Commands before them, and ſo
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:112427:70"/> of bringing them into his houſe, or gracious Government in his Kingdom. Through that there is forgiveneſs of ſins with him, and that held forth to, and for all, that in looking to him they might receive it; through that theſe waters of affliction, and wrath, that would have drowned all, are made as waters of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to thoſe that receive, or put not from them his ſalvation. Upon that ground we call perſons to, and are to receive, and bring them under his wing in the outward diſpenſation. And though its true, he may otherwiſe ſhew mercy to thoſe whom we with the Diſciples would forbid to come to him for outward teſtimonies of it, yet our forbidding ſuch is an implicite (at leaſt) denyal of his grace to them, denyal of his Kingdom in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Regiment thereof, in which is a diſpenſation of his grace and favour more then to others without; though not ſo much as to thoſe more within, and under the Regiment of ſpiritual Renovation, and Communion with him. Yea indeed, if the matter be well looked into, we ſhall find that the greateſt cauſe of moſt mens denying Infant-baptiſm, ſprings from their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Goſpel in its extent, becauſe they know not whether Chriſt hath died for them, and hath opened his Kingdom, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to entertain them, whether he any way looks upon them as under the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and branches of the Church-ſtate ſet up in his family, in this alteration of its form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo whether any of the ſap and juice thence flowing, may he ſhared in by them. Sure, when we deny them Baptiſm, we deny them place in Chriſts Houſe, and the bleſſing accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it; we deny them that wing of God ſtretched out over all upon whom his Name is put for their protection and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till they wilfully break Covenant with him, and run from him; we deny them that place in the prayers and bleſſings of the Church of God put up for all of it, which otherwiſe they ſhould ſhare in; we deny them much, ſo far as lies in our power to deny, or grant to them. But its ſaid again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>Tertulliaen</hi> an Ancienter Writer, who was in <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi> account his Maſter, argues rather for delaying Baptiſm, except in caſe of neceſſity, till they come to riper years. To that I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and after him <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> doth ſo indeed, but then its to be minded, that they neither deny Infant-baptiſm
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:112427:71"/> to have been practiſed in the Church in and before their times, or in the Apoſtles times. Nor 2. That its lawful to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for in caſe of neceſſity they both allow it. Yea, its to be noteds</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it was practiſed in thoſe more ancient times, even within 140 years after Chriſt without any known beginning; for <hi>Tertullians</hi> arguing for their delaying their Baptiſm, implies as plainly that there was then an uſe to baptize them, as in far latter times <hi>Barnards</hi> noting ſome to have denied Infant-baptiſm, proves, That there were Antipedobaptiſts in thoſe latter Ages, in, or before <hi>Bernard's</hi> time: yea, its to be noted alſo,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">Non minori de cauſa innupti quoque procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinandi in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus tentatio per parata eſt, tam virginibus per maturitatem, quam viduis pervagationem, donec aut nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant aut con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinentia corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borentur. <hi>Tex. de Bapt.</hi>
               </note>3. That by the ſame reaſon we may as well deny Baptiſm to young men unmarried, and widdows, though they profeſs faith in Chriſt, for even their delaying Baptiſm too, till either they be married, or are confirmed in chaſtity, that is, in a reſolution of a ſingle life, the ſame <hi>Tertullian</hi> endeavours to perſwade in the ſame place. And indeed, there is as little poſitive mention of young unmarried perſons being baptized, though of twenty years of age, or upward, (that were not ſingle all their lives after it at leaſt) as there is of Infans being baptized, and yet I think no Antipedobaptiſts in the world will deny, that ſuch unmarried perſons, though not reſolved againſt marriage, may lawfully be baptized. Its no rare thing to find the ancient Writers regarding ſome reaſonings of their own to grow ſuperſtitious in delaying, or denying Gods Ordinances, as is evident again in <hi>Tertullian</hi> denying the lawfulneſs of ſecond marriages; and what other but ſuperſtition was <hi>Conſtantines,</hi> and others, putting off Baptiſm, till towards their end? Sure we can find no one Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for putting off perſons that come to be baptized, till a greater knowledge attained, or more exact walking teſtified, or the like. That practiſe rather ſprung from a conceit that Baptiſm cleared them of all their ſins, and ſo they thought it good wiſdom to act out what ſins they had a mind to act, or thought they ſhould act before Baptiſm, rather then after, and ſo they deferred Baptiſm the longer. Beſides, we may note,</p>
            <p n="4">4. That <hi>Tertullian</hi> is as weak to the full in his arguing againſt Infant-baptiſm, as any in arguing for it.</p>
            <p>For, 1. He takes for granted, That that Speech of Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Suffer little children to come to me,</hi> ſpeaks of coming
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:112427:71"/> to Baptiſm: But anſwers it thus, <hi>Viniat dum adoleſcant, &amp;c.</hi> Let them come when they are grown up, let them be made Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians when they can know Chriſt? Were not theſe, or ſome ſuch like, the thoughts of the Diſciples with whom Chriſt was offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? And can that be the meaning of Chriſt, when he rebuked them for not letting them come at the preſent when as yet they were not grown up? and when he in their very Infancy bleſſed them, and ſaid, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdom?</hi> But would <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> indeed have them come then when they are grown up? No, they muſt ſtay a little longer too, till they be married, or ſetled in their reſolution of chaſtity. And whereas he ſays further, <hi>Why ſhould innocent Age haſten to the remiſſion of their ſins?</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, he thought that Baptiſm gave remiſſion, as well as they that reaſoned for it: And indeed, that being granted, his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt needs be the worſe of the two, for he ſpeaks, as if they were ſo innocent, as that they needed no remiſſion, whereas the truth is, They alſo are by nature ſo polluted with ſin, and under the guilt of it, as that they alſo need waſhing and remiſſion, or elſe they cannot be partakers of eternal ſalvation. This ſeems to ſavour rather of the fore-mentioned ground for their delaying Baptiſm, till they have committed many ſins, that ſo therein they might receive the forgiveneſs of them all together, and not with the Scripture-grounds of Baptiſme. Though that God doth hold forth to men the forgiveneſs of their ſins in Chriſt, and ſeals or teſtifies it in Baptiſm, I believe, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſubmitting to his Government by Chriſt, for the future ſhall have remiſſion of what is paſt: yea, by believing in him ſhall meet with eternal ſalvation. And the Church ſo receiving, remits all that was paſt, reckoning them no longer, as in the unbaptized ſtate in the world, but as Subjects unto Chriſt, till after-follies appearing, bring them under new cenſures.</p>
            <p>The practiſe we find then without any known beginning in Eccleſiaſtical Record, but the warrantableneſs of that practiſe we muſt have in the Scriptures. Now what warrant there is for it in the Scriptures, I have before ſhewed: To which I know not what more can be added, except we ſhould take in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy too, that ſpeaks of the <hi>Gentiles bringing in children to the Church of God on their ſhoulders, and in their arms, Iſai.</hi> 49.22. Which why it may not be as literally to be verified as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:112427:72"/> the 23d. <hi>That Kings ſhall be their nurſing Fathers, and Queens their nurſing Mothers,</hi> I think is hard to ſhew: Except we will <hi>jurare in verba,</hi> take this or that mans bare ſaying, its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe for ſufficient proof of it. <hi>Chriſt being a child born to the Jews, and born in Bethlehem-Judah, and his coming meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riding on an Aſs, his being pierced in his hands and feet, their giving him vinegar to drink, and parting his garments, and for his veſtment caſting lots;</hi> all theſe, with many other paſſages, had their literal fulfilling, and why this may not be ſo underſtood too, is not ſufficiently proved by thoſe that deny it. But as of it ſelf, it hath not cleanneſs enough in it to ſatisfie an inquiſitive heart in the point in hand: ſo is the very Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for diſcipling and baptizing, ſo full and general in its expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and other conſiderations before laid down ſeem to be ſo convincing, as that there may be no further need of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall paſs it, and come to the laſt point objected, or to be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. The Form of baptizing in water, what it is, whether dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, plunging, or waſhing with water: Concerning which, I conſider,</p>

I conceive the waſhing with water in whole, or in part, ſo it be into the Name of Chriſt, and to diſciple them into his faith and doctrine, is eſſentially Baptiſm, for ought that I can ſee, ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially produced againſt it, the rather becauſe ſuch waſhing hath that name put upon it, when not uſed in that way, and to that end, as was ſhewed before: therefore ſuch a waſhing to this end, <hi>viz.</hi> into the Name of Chriſt, &amp;c. is very capable of the Name of his Baptiſm, or Baptiſm unto him: for its the uſe or end of the application of water, that is rather to be reſpected in this Ordinance, then the outward form of applying it, there being nothing in all the Scripture by way of preſcription, or tye in it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But what if the Holy Ghoſt himſelf do give us an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:112427:73"/> the authority of the Maſters of the <hi>Greek</hi> tongues, and all the variety of ſignifications that they put upon the word, amongſt whom we find difference enough? Me thinks, I hear all parties agreeing to it, that if we can find an interpretation of that word of his giving, they will liſten to it, becauſe he is an Authour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception, and knew his meaning in his own words, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Scapula, Budaeus, Heſichius, Stephanus, Caſaubon, Zepperus, Beza,</hi> or any other whatſoever.</p>

            <p>To this purpoſe then let us compare the promiſes made by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or predictions concerning his baptizing, and the performance thereof by him, and ſure that Act that he uſed in performing, is a good Interpretation of his meaning in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting and promiſing it. Well then, let us look into <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. and ſee there what <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſays, <hi>I indeed</hi> (ſays he) <hi>baptize you with water to repentance, but there comes one after me mightier then I, he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and fire.</hi> See alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5. <hi>John indeed baptized with water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt not many dayes hence.</hi> Now the queſtion is about the manner of act ſignified in this word <hi>Baptize,</hi> whether it be accompliſhed by dipping, plunging the party baptized into the matter of Baptiſm, or that wherewith he is baptized, or whether it be performed by ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that upon him, or by what other action. Now compare with theſe fore-mentioned Scriptures thoſe paſſages in which this baptizing promiſed was accompliſhed, and they will clearly unfold unto us by what kind of action the ſignification of that word <hi>Baptize,</hi> is anſwered. And firſt, let that be minded, that this promiſe of Chriſt to baptize his Apoſtles and Diſciples with the Holy Ghoſt, was performed on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> that ſoon after followed, as all Interpreters grant, and is ſufficiently clear, by comparing this firſt of the <hi>Acts,</hi> with the next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Chapter.</hi> Where we have the accompliſhment of this promiſe ſpoken to by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> firſt; in the Prophet <hi>Joel's</hi> words, and afterwards in his own, in the Prophet <hi>Joels, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he there) <hi>is that that was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:112427:73"/> ſpoken of by the Prophet Joel, And it ſhall be in the laſt days, ſaith God, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all fleſh, and your ſons and your daughters ſhall prophecy, &amp;c.</hi> In his own, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. <hi>This Jeſus being at the right hand of God exalted, and having received the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, hath ſhed, or poured forth this that ye now ſee, and hear.</hi> What more evident, then that the Holy Ghoſt himſelf here gives this action of pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth the thing wherewith the party is baptized upon the ſaid perſon, as the ſignification and interpretation of the word <hi>Baptize.</hi> That which is called baptizing in the promiſe, being in the performance both in the Prophet, and by the Apoſtle call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>pouring forth, or out upon.</hi> See it further cleared, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Acts</hi> 10.45. with <hi>Acts</hi> 11.16. In the former place its ſaid, <hi>That upon the Gentiles was poured forth the gift of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And in the latter place, <hi>Peter</hi> tells his Brethren, <hi>That therein he called to mind the word of the Lord, who ſaid, John indeed baptized with water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Plainly implying, that in pouring out the Holy Ghoſt upon them, he performed his word of baptizing them with the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Now if Jeſus Chriſt himſelf baptized with this manner of action, pouring the matter wherewith he baptized upon the parties he baptized, and the Holy Ghoſt tells us the act ſignified in the word <hi>Baptize,</hi> be in that manner acted, who can deny that that manner of acting upon the party baptized, is a right way of baptizing them? Can we have a better pattern in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing to imitate, then the Lord himſelf? Or can we baptize in a better form of acting then he? Or can we doubt that this form of pouring out water upon the party baptized, is Baptiſm wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h water, when the ſame form of pouring out Spirit, is plainly the baptizing with Spirit? The difference in the matter of Baptiſm changes not the ſignification of the act implyed in the word <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize:</hi> eſpecially that phraſe of <hi>baptizing with Spirit,</hi> and <hi>pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of Spirit:</hi> having evident alluſion to, and being borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the pouring out of water, and baptizing with water, if baptizing with water be not to be performed by pouring out water upon the perſon we baptize; neither then is it proper to call the pouring out of Spirit upon one the baptizing him with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in Metaphorical Speeches words being borrowed from the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:112427:74"/> things to which the reſemblance is made, and applyed to the things reſembled. Now in that way uſed in the Congregations in <hi>England,</hi> that are Pedobaptiſts, it cannot be denyed that the Act of Baptiſm is performed by pouring water upon the child, or perſon baptized, leſs or more, and leſs and more herein makes no eſſential difference, ſo there be water poured out upon them, with intent to, or for diſcipling to that Name of Jeſus, by the Holy Ghoſts own interpretation of the word, it may truly be called Baptiſm, ſprinkling with water, being not different from pouring out much water upon them, except in the quantity of the water: And both Metaphors are uſed in the Scripture, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the ſame ſpiritual thing ſignified in Baptiſm. As in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.15. <hi>He that is Chriſt ſhall ſprinkle many Nations.</hi> And truly, I am not ſatisfied that the Holy Ghoſt there uſes that expreſſion only to ſignifie his ſprinkling his grace or doctrine upon them, but alſo to ſignifie and foretel the ſprinkling them by way of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm into his Name by his Servants, and that with reference to that fore-ſeen, he uſes this phraſe, to ſignifie his ſprinkling them with his grace or doctrine alſo. Why we may not interpret the Holy Ghoſt as literally here, as in the expreſſions next following, and all along the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> I ſee no convincing reaſon as yet that can be produced. So in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean,</hi> differs not in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from that in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.3, 4. <hi>I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, &amp;c.</hi> Though I confeſs there is another Metaphor in it, and another operation of the grace of God there hinted: So that I hope by the light of this conſideration, the Antipedobaptiſts will ſee that there is no ſuch neceſſity of plunging or dipping for the baptizing a perſon, as men are ready to be perſwaded by they noiſe the make about it.</p>

And why the Apoſtle might not ſpeak of Baptiſm in ſuch a way too, as to ſpeak of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward real Baptiſm of the heart, and not of the fleſh, I ſee no reaſon can be given of any force at all. Nay its ſure the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth ſpeak of Baptiſm in that ſence, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 21. <hi>Baptiſm now ſaves us not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, which is done in the outward act of the external Ordinance, but the ſtipulation or anſwer of a good conſcience through the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt:</hi> which place ſeems well to open and anſwer to that in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. Or,</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we take them to ſpeak alſo of outward baptizing, then it ſhews not ſo much the external form and ceremony of it, as the inward end, intention, and ſcope of it. Its a coming into Chriſt at leaſt, ſo far as to the outward Inſtitution and Government, and ſo a profeſſed Obligation to him, and to his death, to look for all ſalvation there-through, and have fellowſhip with him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. In which the perſon baptized was deaded to the world in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:112427:75"/> its former, or all other Inſtitutions, Religions, Hopes, Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, Priviledges, and as it were buried thereto, (eſpecially as things ſtood in thoſe times, in which he that came under the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and profeſſion of Chriſt, became therein as a man dead, and buried to all eſteem, and repute or love of the world,) that ſo they ſhould, or might <hi>walk in newneſs of life, after the new Inſtitution and Doctrine of Chriſt, unto which we are in Baptiſm delivered, and not according to the old and wild inclinations of our nature or cuſtoms, and inſtitutions of the world.</hi> And this holds true be the external form of baptizing what it will, and let Baptiſm be underſtood to reach as far as it will; for whether the body be dipt or waſht in whole or in part into the Name and profeſſion of Chriſt: A man is thereby buried with him, and made as a dead man out of ſight to the love and eſteem of the enemies of Chriſt; and is obliged and bound to be ſo, as to the hopes, confidences, delights, cuſtoms, and vanities of the world, to be to all them as dead and buried, that ſo he may walk in the Doctrine and Inſtruction of Chriſt, which alſo will render a man as a dead, crucified, or buried thing to the world. And here is a putting on Chriſt, as to external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and obligation, ſo much the outward Baptiſm brings under the bond of, and delivers up unto: And where ever the ſoul is inwardly baptized into the death of Chriſt, there in that death of his its buried with him to all its former hopes, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and principles, really and actually, (though ſpiritually, and not carnally) and therein its quickened up to live to God in <hi>newneſs of life, having really put on Chriſt, as to intereſt in his priviledges, and conformity to him, crucified as to the old man, but quickened in the new.</hi> Which word <hi>(crucified)</hi> is there uſed of that ſaid to be done in Baptiſm, as alſo the word <hi>planting together with him, ver.</hi> 5, 6.

The Death of Chriſt for a man is ſo far from rendring Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm needleſs to that man, that indeed there is no ground for baptizing any man but by vertue of, and upon the account of his death for him. <hi>Chriſt as dead, and riſen for us, is the ground and foundation of all mercies, and of all ordinances, and the promiſe of him was the foundation of all the ordinances before his coming,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. as might eaſily be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Had it not been for his ſtepping in, we had forthwith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on breach of Gods Covenant layn for ever in death and miſery without any mercy, or favour to us, or hope of delivery: but for that Chriſt had not had authority and power over any man to diſpenſe favour to him, or deal otherwiſe with him, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deſert of his ſin, and ſentence of the Law, nor had there been any remiſſion of ſins either to be ſealed to, or ſought for by any perſon, nor no way for adoring or worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God, nor could ten thouſand baptiſms do, or have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man the leaſt benefit, had not Chriſt dyed for him; therefore, me thinks, its ſtrange, that the granting of this ſhould make Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm needleſs, but for which Baptiſm is wholly groundleſs. This might eaſily be retorted againſt himſelf, that there is no ground for baptizing children, or very uncertain if Chriſt dyed not for all; it would then be rather needful of the two, to ſay till they grow up, and give ſome teſtimony of their faith, and ſo hopes that they are of the Election, eſpecially <hi>Baptiſm being into the death of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 4.2, 3. that we may have good ground to baptize them into that that's for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Baptiſm doth neither take ſin out of the nature, nor off of the conſcience: I ſay this <hi>Baptiſm by water,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. much leſs doth it take ſin from before the preſence of God, ſo as that he imputes it not to men, that the having theſe things undone, ſhould be the ground of its Adminiſtration, as the Objection ſuppoſes, while the ſuppoſing thoſe things to be already done by the death of Chriſt, is brought to argue it needleſs. As its the ſufferings of Chriſt that hath ſatisfied for ſin, and redeemed men from under the firſt Covenant, to be now dealt with in, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:112427:78"/> through Chriſt the Mediatour, and hath opened the way for men to God again, ſo its the belief and receipt of the truth, and grace of God, in, and upon which, God forgives and acquits actual ſinners of fore-going ſins, and juſtifies them, and that both waſhes ſins off from the conſcience, and purifies the heart, and converſation. This outward Baptiſm then doth neither after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, nor before, take away ſin. That phraſe, <hi>Ariſe, and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins, calling upon the Name of the Lord, Acts.</hi> 22.13. ſignifies but either, that in calling upon the Name of the Lord, and yielding himſelfe to his Baptiſm, he ſhould,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Declare and manifeſt his hearty cloſing with the Lord Jeſus, and that he did repent him really of his former practiſes againſt him, and ſo ſhould manifeſt, <hi>That he received forgiveneſs of his ſins,</hi> or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſo he ſhould receive the external ſoul, or ratification of forgiveneſs of ſins to the believer.</p>
            <p>And ſo, 3. Receive a Miniſterial forgiveneſs, or waſhing them away, ſo as to be no longer reckoned by the Church a perſecuter of it, and ſtranger from it, but to be owned by them, as clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his former ſins: and that phraſe, <hi>Baptized for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, Acts</hi> 2.38. That that hath ſealed forgiveneſs of ſins in Chriſt to them, to be diſpenſed in believing, and that in yeilding to the Name, and entering into the Profeſſion, and Church of Chriſt, they were in the way to receive it from him, or have it ſealed to them: But thoſe phraſes prove not, That the outward Baptiſm either ſatisfied for, or procured cleanſing in conſcience or heart from ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The having ſin taken away off from men in point of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiouſneſs to puniſhment, or off of their conſciences; yea, the putting a man into ſuch a condition, as in which he is actually capable of ſalvation, and ſo the rendring Baptiſm not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation, doth not take away the need of Baptiſm, or make that the Adminiſtration of it ſhould be groundleſs, for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then none ſhould be baptized at all; for we do not find Baptiſm aſſerted as neceſſary to ſalvation to any in the Scripture, (I mean the outward Baptiſm,) ſo as that without it no ſalvation.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:112427:78"/> We find. <hi>He that believes and it baptized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall be ſaved, Mark</hi> 16.16. but never he that believes muſt be baptized, that or elſe he muſt be damned; Certainly the thief on the croſs, unleſs baptized before, was not at all baptized, yet was ſaved; and ſurely <hi>Cornelius</hi> being juſtified of God, and the Holy Ghoſt being poured upon him, might have gone to Heaven had he dyed then before he was baptized, and many went to Heaven before it was inſtituted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then both the Antipedobaptiſts, and Maſter <hi>Kendal</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize needleſly, for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Antipedobaptiſts ſay,<note place="margin">All its neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, is but a <hi>Neceſſitas pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti,</hi> as the precept for it makes it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </note> They believe before they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſurely if they believe they are actually under the promiſe of forgiveneſs; yea by faith are juſtified from their ſins, and the death of Chriſt without doubt hath diſcharged them before God, and brings remiſſion to their conſciences, and begins to purifie their hearts, and ſo they are tranſlated from death to life, before Baptiſm; therefore by their rule Baptiſm is needleſs for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Maſter <hi>Kendals</hi> principles make it needleſs too, for did not Chriſt dye for the elect Infants; and if ſo, ought they to dye again, or periſh in the ſins Chriſt dyed for? Or ought they not rather, as Maſter <hi>Owen</hi> ſayes, to be diſcharged of all actions and ſuits that may be made againſt them? Say they not all, its unjuſt that Chriſt ſhould bear their ſins, and themſelves too? So that they are ſafe enough from condemnation, nor poſſibly could pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, though not baptized with outward Baptiſm. And as for all other Infants, they can have no good by it, but muſt periſh, it notwithſtanding being reprobate; <hi>Ergo,</hi> no need for Baptiſm by that reaſoning.</p>
            <p>But 3, There are other uſes and ends of Baptiſm, and reaſons of its appointment, in order to which there is need of it: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The obeying and fulfilling Chriſts Commiſſion for diſcipling all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> baptizing them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The bringing or admitting them to Chriſt in his Church or Kingdom for his more ſpecial protection and bleſſing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.13, 14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The diſcipling them to,<note place="margin">1 Cor 10.2. Matth. 28.19.</note> or obliging them to be brought up
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:112427:79"/> to the acknowledgement of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and not in the wayes of prophanneſs, and <hi>Gentiliſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſealing the righteouſneſs of the faith of the Goſpel preached to, and believed by <hi>Abraham,</hi> but more fully perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and declared now; as that though by nature we, and all ours, are unclean, unfit for fellowſhip with God, and admiſſion into Kingdom, yet through the death of Jeſus Chriſt for us there is forgiveneſs for us in him, and for ours, an entrance into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom where bleſſing is to be met with, for making us meet for fellowſhip with himſelf.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſolemn profeſſion of the Parents, or Nurturers faith in the Goſpel of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.4, 5.</note> in bringing them to have his Name put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, with a knd of publick engagement upon themſelves, to bring them up for Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The putting away the <hi>filth of the fleſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. the ſtain of <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> and ſo the putting a Note of diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves with theirs, and the <hi>Heathens</hi> that have not the Name of Chriſt upon them. So that no ground for, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in that Objection flung ſo often in Maſter <hi>Goodwins</hi> diſh, by Maſter <hi>Kendal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed I rather wonder upon what what account he can bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize Infants, that makes the Scripture-language ſo uncertain, as that all Nations or <hi>Gentiles</hi> by his Line of interpretation may poſſibly reach but a few unknown perſons of ſome Nations, and that expreſſes ſuch raſh conceptions of the Reprobation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Infants;<note place="margin">

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which Doctrine, (ſeeing I have had occaſion to mention him) I muſt needs ſay, Maſter <hi>Kendal</hi> is more beholding to his Metaphyſicks, then to the Scriptures, for his belief and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of it.
